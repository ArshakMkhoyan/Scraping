Knightscope,https://www.startengine.com/knightscope,Raymond Hooks,12,Yes,2 days ago,Hello - can you please provide a Company financial update for the year 2019? Is there an investor presentation? Please share the revenue and income.,"Hello Raymond, we report to the U.S. SEC on a bi-annual basis and you can find those regulatory filings here: www.knightscope.com/investors

The Form 1-SA covers 1H 2019. The Form 1-K is due at the end Apr 2020.

For your convenience here are the historical revenues:

2015 pilots
2016 $400K
2017 $1.6 million
2018 $2.9 million

Hope that helps! - Bill"
Knightscope,https://www.startengine.com/knightscope,Guenadi Jilevski,20,Yes,3 days ago,What is the current valuation?,"Guenadi, appreciate the interest and support! The round is in process of getting done at $8 per share or a $310 million pre-money valuation. This compares favorably to pretty much all the deals in the autonomous space (that have no commercially viable product, no customers, no revenue) at $500 million - $2 billion range. Or to a partial competitor funded by Sequoia, Cobalt Robotics, whose last round was done at $200M pre-money valuation and are just in pilot phase with a handful of customers."

Knightscope,https://www.startengine.com/knightscope,Terrance Montgomery,6,No,5 days ago,"Greetings, I have followed this product for some time now and I am almost finished with researching other companies that offer similar products...like SMP Robotics, Corp and others. What makes this company different (better for the investors and clients)?

Side note, thanks for all the updates and information shared on LinkedIn, it's a great way to display your products!","Terrance, thank you for the kind interest! Frankly, one of our greatest competitive advantages is we actually have real clients, with actual real revenue, and actual real product operating across an entire country 24/7/365. No other company can say that - funded or not funded. What we are doing is extremely execution intensive and difficult - and all the primary potential competitors have gone under and/or given up. These are basically self-driving cars and with over $80 billion invested in the space - no one has shipped anything at scale fully autonomous with no human intervention - except Knightscope. Hope that helps! - Bill

P.S. We just crossed 1 million operating hours in the field in the real world.

Knightscope,https://www.startengine.com/knightscope,Ian Gebow,,No,14 days ago,"I have spent the portions of the last several days reviewing the available information regarding Knightscope and am very interested in the technology as an investor during this offering. I would be interested to know how you are getting information regarding your products and services to potential customers who may in fact not know they are available. As mind-blowing as they are, the NASDAQ Channel, CNBC and Popular Science are not exactly flying across everyone's TVs and iPads. Are you contacting potential clients directly? Forgive me if this has already been addressed.","Ian, thank you for the interest! Yes, this matter has been addressed but need to think about sequencing. We have a considerable backlog of new orders - and need to focus on securing additional equity capital to scale up the company and fund the growth. Need to do that first, before securing more business. Yes, our sales team (which will grow significantly after this financing) reaches out and deals with clients on one-to-one basis. Hope that is understandable."
Knightscope,https://www.startengine.com/knightscope,Frank Costello,,No,17 days ago,Has anyone invested using IRA Funds and kept the investment in a tax deferred status? Would like more info on the process required - better yet - an investor that has successfully done this. I am looking to invest using IRA funds w/out taking a distribution to do so.,"Hello Frank! Yes, so long at is a self-directed IRA, numerous folks have done so. There are 3 options for you:

1. If you have an existing self-directed IRA....AND the firm allows private investments in startups then you should be all set. A great deal of the larger firms either don't allow it or provide a nightmare of paperwork that make it almost impossible.

2. Our managing broker-dealer at StartEngine has there own solution and can help you through the process - you can reach out to them directly at contact@startengine.com and they'll be happy to assist.

3. At Knightscope, we wrote a blog about it and you can learn more here:

StartEngine,https://www.startengine.com/startengine-crowdfunding,John mensah,2,No,6 days ago,"I was curious about this so if investing in start engine itself you actually do get shares as well as the bonus just so I understand fully because I am interested just want to make sure..

I think it was answered but just making sure asi am very interested because I think your fking s great thing here.

Thank you","Hi John,

As I mentioned in a comment below and as I hope is clear in the campaign page above this comment section, the primary purpose of investing in this offering is to receive StartEngine shares. The bonus is just that: a bonus. It is a perk to reward those who show us more support than just investing the minimum investment amount in this offering.

StartEngine,https://www.startengine.com/startengine-crowdfunding,Adaly Rosado,2,No,7 days ago,Can you lower the minimum purchase price to 100?,"Hi Adaly,

Thank you for being an investor in our community. Unfortunately, we will not be adjusting the minimum investment amount of this offering.

StartEngine,https://www.startengine.com/startengine-crowdfunding,Joseph F. Ricciardi III,2,No,8 days ago,"If I choose to invest in the Start Engine platform, why cant we receive interest or equity depending on the amount of money we invest? At this point it appears that my minimum $1000 is a loan for Start Engine that I do not receive anything in return except the possibility of selling shares in the future, which is not guaranteed. Is there something I am missing?","Hi Joseph,

I think there is some confusion, so let me try to clarify. This is an equity offering. The price per share in this offering is $7.50, and the minimum investment amount is $502.50 (67 shares). If you wanted to, you could invest a higher amount in this offering, and in return you would receive more stock. In the case of investing $1,000 or more, you would also receive our Owner's Bonus perk. This is not a loan. You receive shares in exchange for your investment.

As for the possibility of selling those shares in the future, you are right that it is not guaranteed. There is currently no way for investors to sell their StartEngine shares. We are working on getting regulatory approval for an investor trading platform, which you can read more about on our campaign page, but I cannot say if or when we will launch that trading platform because its approval is dependent on FINRA and the SEC.

I believe in StartEngine's future and the platform's potential, but no one can predict the future or guarantee success.

StartEngine,https://www.startengine.com/startengine-crowdfunding,John Weaver,,No,11 days ago,"Wow. How's this for absolute BS?
""How do I view my subscription agreement?
You can view your signed subscription agreement by logging into your StartEngine account. Click your name in the top right hand corner, and select ""View Investments"". You should see a list of all of your investments that have the option to view your signed Subscription Agreement.

Note: You will not be able to view the subscription agreement until the company closes on your funds, and your status changes from ""received"" to ""invested"". ""

So... StartEngine - and, by association, any company taking our money, requires me to state that I've read the ""subscription agreement"" when that agreement won't be made available for me to read until AFTER I have invested in the company and the company has secured the funds I provided. Wow. Sounds unethical and criminal.","Hey John,

I will reply to all of your questions in a single comment here. Firstly, our Investor Services has emailed you a copy of the subscription agreement for your investment in TFN. After reading that document, you can cancel your investment if you find it to be unsatisfactory.

Secondly, you should be able to read the subscription agreement from the invest page. It appears as a pop-up when you click that link you mentioned redirected you to the home page. You may have had pop-ups blocked on your browser.

Thirdly, regarding the quote you mention above, you caught a copy error. It should read ""you will not be able to view your signed subscription agreement until the company closes on your funds, and your status changes from 'received' to 'invested'."" Any investor can read the subscription agreement, but they won't receive a copy with their signature until the point mentioned above. That change has since been fixed. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

Fourthly, as for the types of businesses on StartEngine, on our platform you invest in startups and early-stage businesses. These are private investment opportunities, and the majority of them are not publicly-traded at this stage of their development.

Shares you purchase in Regulation A+ offerings are available for trade immediately and shares you purchase in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings are tradeable after a one year lock-up period.

However, the issue we are trying to address at StartEngine is that there is currently nowhere to trade these shares. We hope to launch an investor marketplace where StartEngine users can buy and sell shares that were originally issued on our platform. That marketplace is pending regulatory approval, so we cannot say if or when we will be able to launch that trading platform.

As for other ways to exit your investment, you could also possibly see a return if the business you invest in IPOs or gets acquired at some point in the future. However, investing in startups is risky: the majority of startups fail. You should not invest more than you are willing to lose.

Although a lot of our technology is novel and we could spend the resources to develop a more robust patent strategy, we don't believe the costs incurred are worth the value in exchange, considering that defending a patent in litigation is more costly than the actual patent itself, and the application process requires us to fully disclosure and reveals our technology to the public.

If I read your form C correctly, among the 2 remaining founders, you also own majority of the company. Even if you're the most skilled ninja out of the original 4 founder, it's kind risky if you're the CEO and the only director on the board because there's too much dependency on one individual. Could you shed some light on how you plan to mitigate this kind of risks? Thanks.","Hi Helen, thanks for the message and great questions! Yes, after 4 years together a couple of the co-founders were ready to explore other things, start families, plan to move internationally, etc. It was bittersweet but all very amicable. They have remained major shareholders and involved with various aspects of the company, although they did relinquish their Board seats at that time, leaving just one sole director. Nonetheless, the remaining founders, Sergio and I, along with our senior engineers, do make collective decisions about the direction of our technology and company, although we never took to the task of formalizing a new Board.

Waverly Labs Inc.,https://www.startengine.com/waverly-labs-inc,Jeff Park,9,No,4 months ago,"Hi - What an amazing product. A few questions.
1. When was the last funding round? What was the pre-money valuation?
2. Have you raised from VCs to date? If not, do you plan to?
3. Can you elaborate on the B2B testing? Are these paid pilots?
4. Going forward will the enterprise segment (Ambassador) be the larger business vs. B2C? Was there a Kickstarter type of crowdfunding for the Ambassador?
5. What type of services are offered with the subscription?
6. Why are you raising only $535k in this round?","Hi Jeff, thanks for the message. We did an equity campaign in 2017 with our community at an $11MM pre-money valuation, and as we make the pivot to tackle B2B markets with Ambassador we’re keeping our new valuation modest as well to maximize shareholder returns. We’ve also initiated strong conversations with VCs around our new direction and we expect to close a round in the near future as we get closer to distributing Ambassador. The B2B customers with whom we are testing are paid customers of Ambassador, and we expect that professional users, along with medium to large organizations, will make up the majority of customers, vs B2C users. The subscription services will include features such as offline translation, custom vocabularies, and saved transcripts, which are key features for these professional users. And the $535k fundraising size ahead of the holiday period was ideal based on the regulatory hurdles that would be required under a larger round size, such as the 3 month SEC review period of a Form 1A for a large equity campaign. Thanks for the questions!"

I travel internationally for work often ... They have been AMAZING in helping communicating with Japanese, Spanish, Italian & German clients.""

But what we learned from those first customers is that we needed to make the sharing experience more fluid by allowing multiple units to sync together, which is how we designed Ambassador. Also we made major upgrades to the capability to capture speech with higher quality, which ultimately means better translation accuracy. Thanks for the question!"

It's more like a translation dictionary of simple phrases instead of translating for conversation, which is what we focus on developing and why it requires our users to be online - it's a very computational heavy task to fit into an app or handheld translator.

"HYLETE, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/hylete-2019,AC Chiu,,No,3 months ago,"I'm a long time Hylete investor since 2013 (through Circle Up). First off, I would like to give credit to Ron Wilson and Hylete for always being forthcoming with investor information as they have it. I've talked to Ron over the phone a couple of times and I've always found him to be a person of integrity. His success at other companies is one of the reasons I invested at Hylete. I've watched Hylete grow their revenue tremendously with a very limited budget and that's been pretty impressive.
My question is whether you have any revenue and profit targets/forecasts that you can share for 2020 and 2021. Also, $5 million is not an insignificant some of revenue but do you see it being enough to achieve your aggressive growth plans? I know you were originally looking for $15-17 million through an IPO before. Thanks.","Hi Albert,

Thank you for questions! Please see the answer below, provided by HYLETE CEO, Ron Wilson:

""Good Morning Albert,

I believe you have been part of HYLETE for over five years now, so I thank you for your long-term support and your strong belief in the brand that you helped build. Your questions are spot on, and I am glad you posted them on the portal to give me a chance to answer them for all former and prospective investors.

You are correct that our IPO raise had targeted a minimum of $15M. This raise amount was designed to allow us to grow our revenue more rapidly than our past performance of 40% cumulated average revenue growth since 2013. Also, the traditional IPO process (S-1 registration) typically requires a minimum of $10M raise to not only get Investment Banks interested but also to gain approval from NYSE American listing go ahead. We elected to target the $15M level to achieve the rapid growth that institutional investors were seeking as part of our post-IPO forecasts/strategy. Ironically, this hyper-growth with losses being tolerated by institutional investors quickly turned, and we elected to delay our IPO process to pursue a strategy of more consistent growth and, most importantly, profitability.

Our current forecast is that we can achieve revenues of approximately $18M in 2020 and $25M in 2021. With the Section 321 changes (see below comments on this portal for more information), we have the opportunity to save nearly $1.5M in 2020 and ~$2.5M in 2021. This strategic initiative is the most important one for achieving profitability by the fourth quarter or 2020 and from that point forward. Also, see below on the debt conversions to equity, which are also paramount to improving our balance sheet and significantly decreasing our interest expense in 2020 and 2021.
With the renewed strategy for managed growth, profitability, and debt to equity conversions, we anticipate that $5M is the amount required for our IPO and listing on the OTCQ or OTCQX in mid-2020. We believe that this amount is sufficient to allow us to achieve profitability and then seek additional financing, as needed, in the latter part of 2020. If market conditions are favorable, which would provide institutional investment coupled with the continued support of the HYLETE nation, we believe we can raise a more significant amount of equity investment and list on NYSE American or Nasdaq.

We believe that we need to focus on this new strategy that insulates us from the macroeconomic conditions in the market by relying on our community for growth. Regardless, HYLETE'e IPO is one of my primary initiatives, and I believe we are positioned to accomplish this in 2020.

Thanks again and have a great day,""

"HYLETE, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/hylete-2019,Jun T,,No,3 months ago,"I am also a multi round investor and agree Steven's comment accurately reflects our current state.
There was a time when I was bullish about Hylete and would forward the live crowdfunding campaigns to my network to get them to invest. Nowadays, I can no longer do that in good conscience.
Perhaps the WeWork debacle changed investor sentiment towards money losing businesses and had a large part to do with our own failed reception on the public market.
One thing is for sure though: the amount of debt we have and the interest payment required to service it is absolutely crippling. Turning to crowdfunding every few months and giving away ""lifetime 50% off"" accounts to investors big and small may sound like a good way to recruit ""brand investomers,"" but it's essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul because our core customer base is now paying merchandise at cost, compressing our gross margins, and shrinking our gross income.
I have the upmost respect for the team and know they are working hard at making Hylete a success. But as a shareholder, I must urge management to address our debt burden or else it will eventually consume the entire business.","Hi Jun, please see the answer to your comment from HYLETE CEO, Ron Wilson, below. Thanks!

""Hi Jun, first, thank you for being an investor. The traditional IPO process created additional debt that was targeted to convert at IPO and thus be relieved from our balance sheet. Fortunately, most of the debt on our balance sheet is held by investors who also own significant equity stakes. We are close to finalizing a plan that would convert this debt to equity. As part of this proposed plan, our senior secured lender would extend its maturity date and also convert its IPO bridge notes to equity, as well.

This debt to equity plan has been an integral aspect of us deciding to open up this current crowdfunding round. A Reg CF is the most expedient path to public equity investments, and we believe that it is priced to account for our current balance sheet status. Our proposed Reg A to OTC listing will require approximately two months to obtain a qualified offering and obtain the additional 4 to 5 million to allow us to not only publicly list all of our company equity, but also achieve profitability by the end of 2020.

As for the IPO market, the trade war with China and Peloton’s lackluster IPO debut proved to be a double negative for us. As for the trade war, we will be in the position by early next year to ship products direct to our US customers without us paying duties or tariffs. We will utilize the Customs Section 321 Program to ship on-line orders directly to our US customers without being hit with any duties or tariffs. This is the same law that allows you to vacation, for example, in Europe and then bring the goods purchased abroad back into the US without duty or tariff, so long as the value is $800 or less.

For more information see: https://www.cbp.gov/trade/trade-enforcement/tftea/section-321-programs

Additionally, it appears that Peloton has rebounded from its IPO and is currently trading up. With a renewed focus on debt conversions to equity and achieving profitability in late 2020, we are optimistic about our opportunity to go public in mid-2020.""

This offering is mindboggling.

Hylete is attempting to crowdfund $1,070,000 by printing colorful pictures, cherry-picking investment highlights, offering “bonus shares,” and burying the risks and discussion of the company’s real financial position in the legal documents.

The offering document and the registration statement filed with the SEC in the failed IPO indicate that ABOVE the equity (what the company is selling to investors on this site) Hylete has roughly ~$10,000,000 in indebtedness (loans, promissory notes, and bonds) at a weighted average interest rate of 12.49%.

Below that, but still, ABOVE the equity, there are three tranches of preferred stock with a total liquidation preference of over ~$7,000,000. The preferred shares are also accruing cumulative dividends at 12% per year!

Hylete’s cash balance on 6/30/2019 was only ~$430K, and the business burned ~$4.95M in cash from operations and capital expenditures in the twelve months leading up to 6/30/2019.

This offering sadly appears to be an attempt to generate cash from the unsuspecting public for an insolvent company.

Please address the current financial position in detail so that investors can more clearly see the risks they face.

Please indicate how this $1M, which is not even adequate to cover interest expense for a full year, will make any material difference in the financial position of Hylete over the next 12 months.

Please make the case for why taking an equity position in Hylete is a prudent choice for our hard-earned cash. Given that the equity sits below a large mountain of senior securities, the business exhibits massive negative cash flows and has almost no cash in the bank.

b) we have projected revenues in 2020 of around $0.7M, but we are in discussion with several potential partners hence this may change. In 2020, we shall probably be loss-making as we invest to scale up manufacturing. Also our TitanStackTm project for a large stack for grid scale applications will require investment.
c) outside of the US, we intend to work with local partners to manufacture our batteries locally under license. We have several discussions ongoing but I cannot confirm the countries:
d) it is our intention to give our shareholders liquidity as soon as possible although it may be difficult to commit to a date;

Thank you and your team for creating Atlis - I really love the concept and target market for Atlis Motor Vehicles. I know as a startup you focus more on developing the truck and getting everything that is in-house together. I just have a few questions and maybe suggestions.
1- Social Media Marketing - I did check out Atlis social media accounts and find that it will need more information and content.
2-Content is King- More videos, images, information about Atlis truck - (videos on testing, etc) images are good, but videos have more impact.
3-No side mirrors - is that already approve or is it in process to being approve.
4-Also will there be an option to have a Panoramic Sunroof, that would be great for me.

Congrats on getting into Invest Southwest.

Thanks for your respond,

T.S","Hi Typhany Stewart,

1 - We are working to create more posts as we progress.
2 - We completely agree.
3 - There is an effort to get this approved and indications are that by the time we've reached the market this should be possible to achieve.
4 - No sunroof at this time on the truck. Would this be possible in the future? Perhaps, but this is not a hard requirement at this time.

"Atlis Motor Vehicles, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/atlis-motor-vehicles-3,Roy Walker,4,No,16 days ago,"Gas is a super-high energy density product, batteries are not. With our new technologies of fracking we'll have oil for the next 100 years. We're not running out of oil this century at least.

IC cars are a lot cheaper to build than electric and the roi on electric is no where close.

All that said, I'd be willing to invest based on the desire of greenies alone. I don't mind making money off of them. So, we can ignore these issues.

But, here's the killer: Tesla is already building electric trucks and that is already a massive company. How are they going to compete with Tesla?

If they don't have a really good answer for that question, this is a terrible investment.","Hi Roy.

Fantastic question. From a market perspective Tesla has built a lifestyle truck with limited capabilities and market focus. Atlis Motor Vehicles is building a pickup truck with a specific focus on work centric vehicles.

Tesla is a consumer centric company, Atlis Motor Vehicles is a work centric company.

From battery technology perspective. We're developing new technologies that allow for ultra fast charging. 15 minutes from 0% to 100%. With long cycle lifes (2,000+ cycles).

We're focused on true truck capabilities. Core to that is the battery technology, then followed by other systems. 500 mile range trucks, with true towing capabilities. Modular architectures for continued expansion into different work applications and medium duty vehicles. Versatility in application."

Fisher Wallace Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/fisherwallace,Roger Austin,6,No,2 months ago,"Is it correct that your current device does not collect data, but a future device likely will?

Data collection could very well really improve engagement of the user and effectiveness of the device.

How would that data be managed? Who would have access to it? How would such data be protected? Would GDPR and/or HIPAA apply to the data? If the company were sold (after the celebrations) how might the data be managed under new corporate leadership (would current company transfer any data to the buying company)? Would there be an option that the future device be used without data collection?

I'll take my aluminum foil hat off now and take the answer off the air.","Hi Roger, thanks for the questions. The device does not currently collect data but a future device will. We also have the option of collecting data using the current device by deploying an app that surveys patients re: treatment results as well as provide usage reminders, etc, while maintaining data privacy. Today there are many HIPAA compliant software vendors that we can work with for such an app. The identity data can remain private between the patient and his/her provider, and any data used by the company, ie, performance data, can be anonymized for analytics purposes. We are in talks now with software providers. In the past, we have beta tested software from Neuroflow (https://www.neuroflowsolution.com/) which has developed a platform for providers to monitor patient treatment. In the event of an acquisition of the company, the acquiring company would be held to the same privacy standards as Fisher Wallace, under HIPAA and other regulation. I agree that anonymized performance data as well as the ability to remind patients to use the device, and to provide other guidance for treating mood and sleep through the app, will be a great added benefit - but of course it's critical that personal health information is protected. Blockchain and other technologies are making this easier to accomplish in the healthcare space - data is one of the areas of healthcare that has been enormously impacted by tech in the past few years."

We have not actively marketed the device for pain for many years - we decided to focus on depression, anxiety and insomnia for which we have FDA Clearance and OTC approval in Europe.

We are definitely developing new products - whether that is Kortex (introduced 2 years ago) or our system-on-a-chip based technologies, upcoming app design and other products, as described in the StartEngine video. Medicaid in Maine covers our device and we are actively in discussions with other Medicaid providers to expand coverage.

Appreciate clarification. Thanks so very much ;-)","Hi Belinda and thanks for your questions / interest!

Fisher Wallace was an LLC prior to us converting to a C Corp in order to raise capital on StartEngine. The way we executed the conversion essentially involved the Corp acquiring the assets from the LLC in a stock transaction. This is why the LCC is shown has owning equity in the Corp, as it represents the equity interests of the founders - Charles Fisher and Kelly Roman, as well as Will Fisher and Matt Fisher own 100% of the LLC interests, however the Corp then issued stock, which diluted the founders, for the StartEngine raise. I think you may be misreading the percentages of what is assigned to the LLC for the founders v the C Corp shares. This has been approved by StartEngine's SEC compliance team, which ensured the the C Corp owns all the assets previously owned by the LLC, and that the issuance of shares was properly handled. This is also why the Corp has an inception date of July 2019 and reports zero - we will be releasing our first Corp financial update as required by SEC regulation, which will show financial performance from the time of inception.

The standards of care - drug therapy and behavioral therapy - will not cede market share quickly or easily, but providers and patients are much more open to wearable neurostimulation today than 10 years ago, and payers are aggressively seeking less expensive ways to treat mood and sleep - which is why we gained our first Medicaid state approval last year."

I just looked at the IASIS website - I had never heard of it before. IASIS does not appear to have any FDA indication or published clinical trial data.

Fisher Wallace Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/fisherwallace,Viral Trivedi,16,No,4 months ago,Thanks Kelly for the detailed and thoughtful responses.

I know the specifics are out of scope here but would you be able to break down the largest chunks in there? 2) The business has been around for more than a decade. The fact that you are profitable obviously squashes all other concerns but have you faced any roadblocks that have worked against a more exponential growth? 3) When will the v2 of the device be launched? 4) What do you see as a likely exit?,"Thanks Viral. Our expenses are broken down by operations (staff, rent, etc), COGS (cost of goods sold), advertising, and refunds/discounts. Advertising is our largest monthly expense, but we have achieved consistent 2X ROAS (return on ad spend) over past few years - and expect that to scale consistently as we grow over the next few years. Our growth is currently limited by ad spend - we hit the limit on ad budget without outside capital to deleverage personal risk. With outside capital, we can start to increase ad spend incrementally (incrementally to track and preserve ROAS). July 2020 is when we anticipate completion of Version 2. Likely exit in my view would be strategic acquirer sometime after our run rate is north of $10M, and we could probably consider IPO around the $40M run rate mark."

Are there sufficient research results to conclude the efficacy of one over the other? 4) Sorry if I missed it in the presentation but how does the competitive landscape look like?","Thanks Viral!

Most medical devices (from stents to heart valves to hip replacements) are FDA-Cleared, which means they came to market via the 510K process, which requires ""substantial equivalence"" to a ""predicate device"" - ie, devices already cleared that are very similar. Only drugs require FDA-Approval before coming to market. Our device category - CES - has been FDA-Cleared since 1974. Our specific device obtained FDA-Clearance in 1990. The FDA has proposed approval for our device class via the reclassification process, as the FDA has acknowledges our devices poses low risk, but that process may take several years to conclude - in the meantime, we can market our device for our indication (depression, anxiety, insomnia) precisely the same way as if it was FDA-Approved. Bottom line - FDA approval will not change the way we can market our device, although it will improve the consumer optics and in some cases, improve insurance coverage, as some payers require approval of devices to cover them.

Only Medicaid in Maine (MaineCare) has 100% insurance coverage for our device. Many payers (private and TRICARE) will reimburse the purchase if the patient submits a letter of medical necessity written by their provider (we provide a template on our site) - that process is burdensome for the patient, so the majority of patients pay out of pocket - yet they may obtain a refund if they return their device under our 30-day refund policy. Approximately 15% of our customers return their device for a refund (which is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales).

AC current has been shown in multiple published studies to entrain an alpha wave brainstate - DC current has not demonstrated the ability to entrain a brainwave state. Aside from that, the biggest difference between AC and DC is the regulatory approvals / clearances. DC current does not yet have any approval or clearances in the US to treat depression, anxiety or insomnia; as a result, we do not consider DC current a significant competitor at this time. It's possible a DC current device will obtain approval or clearance by FDA to treat one of these symptoms, but very likely not two or three symptoms - and even if they obtain it for one symptom, it will likely be limited to narrow diagnosis (ie, patients who fail on at least one antidepressant), as opposed to our very broad indication to treat these symptoms in any patient population. The breadth of our indication is a primary reason why our device has access to an enormous market.

In terms of true competition, I view drug therapy and behavioral therapy as primary, and TMS as secondary - TMS has approval to treat depression, but is much more expensive and not an in-home, wearable treatment (TMS requires multiple office visits and is administered by a psychiatrist - and typically costs $12,000, and does not have a large effect size compared to traditional drug therapy). Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) are also competitive for depression treatment, but do not have the same safety, ease of use or cost advantages that we have.

Please LMK if you have any other questions - Thanks!"
Fisher Wallace Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/fisherwallace,Alan Jacobson,30,Yes,4 months ago,Thanks again Kelly. This one checks all the boxes for me. I'm in. Best of luck!,Thanks Alan!
Fisher Wallace Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/fisherwallace,Alan Jacobson,30,Yes,4 months ago,"Thanks Kelly, I appreciate the thoughtful and thorough answer. The credit card now makes sense - you might be charged fees or some sort of daily rate with a credit line, but the credit card is free if paid down monthly. One follow-up: What do the patents cover? And how hard would it be for another company to also use neuromodulation to address depression and anxiety successfully? By the way, 70% success rate is absolutely amazing. You quote that that is double the rate of medication, but I think you're being generous to medication - factoring out studies paid for by drug companies there is research that shows that medications are no better than placebo.","Thanks Alan, we filed a provisional patent this past April for system-on-a-chip (SoC) version of our specific neurostimulation as well as CES and tACS output in general, here is the dropbox link to the abstract: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k83y0jsz09yk8i4/AbstractEmbed.pdf?dl=0

Competitors would be able to compete with a PCB (printed circuit board) but would infringe on our patent (once accepted by USPTO) if they deployed an SoC. We believe that the longer term future of neurostimulation will include an SoC format to scale and embed in other devices such as smartwatches and phones. Ultimately, the defendability of the IP may lie with our strategic acquirer that would have much greater resources, but developing the IP now makes strategic sense to us. We certainly intend to file the final patent documentation with detailed engineering before April 2020 deadline.

The 70%+ effectiveness rate is reported by Dr. Richard Brown based on his high volume case reports - he has now prescribed the device over 700 times (400 at the time of the quote in The Wall Street Journal). This is in line with what we have seen with our small subject size studies and is reflected by our <15% return rate under our 30-day refund policy. Once we integrate symptom tracking / patient monitoring with the device, we will have much better post market surveillance data (which can be anonymized). I believe we need to invest in one or two more larger studies as we are able to reinvest EBITDA at larger run rate, and potentially through follow on rounds of investment, in order to secure the clinical trial data needed for broad insurance coverage and broader prescriber adoption. But even for a skeptical prescriber, our device poses so little risk (1% side effects rate, all minor such as headache) that the risk benefit is already more appealing than drug therapy as a first line treatment, but of course it will take more time and data to really move the needle in a massive way with prescribers. We are doing the best we can with the data we have and the convincing prescriber reports we have from doctors such as Richard Brown."
Fisher Wallace Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/fisherwallace,Alan Jacobson,30,Yes,4 months ago,"Hi, being in the healthcare field I am impressed with your clinical results and the potential of the product. Your financials are quite confusing however. You have taken out a high amount of credit card debt even though you had a (presumably lower interest) credit line available to you. You say you do not need this raise to stay in business in perpetuity, yet you got a going concern designation. And instead of YTD numbers you have numbers from 12/31/18 and then blank financials that start on 7/18/19. Can you please describe YTD revenue and net, as well as cash on hand and monthly burn? Also, please clarify the debt you carry and when it will come due. Finally, what will investors' relationship be to the patent for this device - does the company we are investing in own the patent or at least hold its exclusive rights forever? Thanks","Thanks for your comment and interest. The credit card debt is typically paid down in full every month - it is primarily used to charge our monthly online advertising (Google, Facebook primarily) which is roughly the same every month ($200K). YTD revenue is fairly flat as we need to increase our ad spend to increase revenue. We don't have a consistent monthly burn rate - some months we make money and some months we do not, while overall we have made a modest profit each year. Another lever for increasing profit is lowering COGS, and we are exploring options to do (as part of Version 2 product development). The debt we carry is a loan made to the company by co-founder Chip Fisher and the terms of repayment are 20% of year end profits. Fisher Wallace was an LLC prior to recently converting to a C Corp in preparation for fundraising, and the C Corp acquired all the assets of the LLC, including the patents and trademarks - so yes, the company you are investing in owns the patents and trademarks."
Rayton,https://www.startengine.com/raytonone,Woyengikuro Yaboh,13,Yes,a month ago,What percentage of the companies equity are we entitled to? As in those of us that are investing on the StartEngine platform.,"Hi Woyengikuro. This round is structured as a convertible note which pays 10% interest after Dec 2020 and converts to common stock with a 30% discount upon the triggering event. The notes convert once an additional $5M has been raised for the company in a qualified equity financing round. The valuation for this current round of investors is what the future valuation on that $5M round is, with a discount rate of 30% (i.e., if the future round is at a $30M valuation, these notes would convert into shares at a valuation of $21M). If by that future qualified equity financing round the value of the company exceeds $50M, then the notes would convert at a valuation of the lesser of $50M, or the future round valuation with the discount of 30%. If we do not undertake a qualified equity financing round by the maturity date, then the note requires that investors be paid 10% interest on their notes, with the notes converting to common stock at the $50M valuation. We chose the 10% interest rate as it is a higher rate of return than what can be found in an S&P 500 Index Fund in order to compensate for the risk inherent in this investment. Thank you."

DIVINIA Water,https://www.startengine.com/diviniawater,Sofiane khouas,3,No,a month ago,"Hey Divinia Team

There are some questions I wanted to ask a long time ago I am glad that you guys extended the offering period:

Just by doing the math the average person drinks around half a gallon of water a day ( 64 oz) around 4 bottles of Divinia water, with your average pricing around ($0.29 / Fl Oz) I am looking at 18 $ a day with 3 people on the house that's over 50 $ a day for water

I am sure your water is pure and special but that's a lot to pay for water,
1-why is it so expensive?
2- what’s your plan to make it affordable?

Thank you for taking the time to answer this questions","One of the reasons for the Total cost is partly due to the shipping costs right now. They are over 48% of the cost. The reason for this is multifold. We are in a smaller town in Idaho so the shipping costs from here to a hub is higher. We must package the product so that it is virtually idiot proof from breaking in shipping because the purity of the water dictates that it be in glass. So this means a specially designed shipping cardboard box that is heavy walled with specially housed shock proof sections for protecting the glass.

In the future we would like to open up plants in major cities that service the local area. That will reduce the cost, plus when we have a larger amount of materials that we purchase it will give us better buying power. Thus future growth should lower costs. I would like to point out however that we have lowered the costs over the past three years and have not raised them.

Also, as we move into other water production markets for different products, the amount of water produced will increase and the cost of the water should eventually decrease.

And, as I might remind you, this is not like any type of water any place else due to its properties. It takes multiple stages of purification and is distilled twice, one of them through our process. It is not like it is run through a filter and then bottled, it is a long intensive process to produce the water, and purity is our concern along the entire process.


Thank you for your questions.

I love the vision and mission of this new company, and as a believer I was very impressed to read your statement of faith on your website and to know that you will present those views in your content.

The only question I have is on your previous venture Aro Lucha, I see it was a similar style fan owned production company for a different target market. Were you able to have a successful exit on that company or is it still operating today? Did the Wefunder investors receive a return on their investment?
Thanks,
Nick","Hi Nicholas, thanks for the comment. Appreciate the encouragement on this venture as well; this one is near and dear to my heart as it is a company that allows me to live out my faith Sunday to Monday.

With regards to Aro Lucha, you are correct. That was a similar company that I founded with 4 other partners. Two of those partners were ex-WWE guys who got into operations and television production after their talent careers ended (both are believers as well), so they have a deep understanding of that business, storytelling, television production, and just all things sports entertainment and professional wrestling. Aro Lucha is a family friendly product that is designed to serve the Latino and Hispanic audiences living in the United States and abroad, but especially kids and families. The high flying action, colorful masks, and other elements make it perfect for kiddos...it's almost very super hero..ish. I still love it and my kids love it!

That company is still operating today. My partners are focused on that company and Ron Harris is running it. The investors in that company still own their stock. There have been no liquidity events to date.

Appreciate the question and opportunity to answer it. Thanks Nicholas."

Called Higher Studios,https://www.startengine.com/called-higher-studios,Alisha Abril,,Yes,13 days ago,"Hi, as a believer, I want to say I am all in but it is prudent to look into the people behind it. Look at their LinkedIn profiles, see their work history, see what they’ve successfully made in the past (not just what they tell you they’ve made). Your screen writer was a hiring manager for Regal theaters a year ago, and a bartender from 2017-2019. It does show he’s written 2 or 3 screenplays but did they ever go anywhere? Ash Greyson looks okay, but his history isn’t lengthy either. You, the man behind it all have very little history. Most of your endorsements are for marketing/advertising. I just don’t want to commit to an awesome marketing scheme that may fall short if it’s not seriously legit. Need real answers and they should be public. Thanks.","Hi Alisha, first off I want to say thank you for your investment and your questions…they are direct and to the point which I respect. I’m happy that you are a believer; it means we’re aligned with God’s ultimate purpose, and you’re just doing some due diligence. Your question gives me an opportunity to point the answer back to Christ, which is what our company is built on. I can only imagine that people in Jesus’ day made statements like, ”He’s just a carpenter”, or “The guys with him…they were fishermen… a tax collector, or that guy used to kill Christians.” What a wonderful thing that God can take unlikely people and do unlikely things.

I’ll try to take your question in parts and answer each. First off, Ash, in some form or another, has worked on over 90 films. When you look at the Top 10 Highest grossing faith-based films of all time, if I recall correctly…I believe he has worked on 4 of them…to me that’s astonishing. He has produced projects, directed others, and he has excellently marketed many, many more, either personally or through his company Ribbow Media. Ash has been influential on making sure that films are seen and attended by audiences around the globe. Some of the films that he has worked on are God’s Not Dead, I Can Only Imagine, Breakthrough, Unplanned, Like Arrows, I’m Not Ashamed, God’s Not Dead 2, Woodlawn, Son of God, 2016 Obama’s America and many more. He is currently working on I Still Believe, which is scheduled to come out this year in Q1 I believe. You can find his credits on IMDB here: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1506084/

In summary on Ash, he has producing credits, directing credits, and definitely marketing credits on some of the most popular faith based films of the last 10 years. We’re very lucky to have him. As for his history not being “lengthy”, he produced his first project in 1997…that is a 23-year history; I would humbly submit that qualifies for lengthy experience.

As for myself, I have a degree in film and have started multiple companies. I owned a production company that filmed over 100 episodes of network tv for Impact wrestling that aired on POPtv. I have also produced two films, early in my career, and multiple commercials. When I produced my films, I noticed issues that made it very difficult for independent producers and filmmakers to succeed in the industry. It was for this reason that I gravitated into entrepreneurship where I worked for a track homebuilder in Newport Beach, CA, founded my first advertising agency, and also owned a construction company for many years. It wasn’t until 2016 when Obama signed into law the JOBS Act, which created the opportunity for fans to own a portion of companies under the new Regulation CF and Regulation A processes, that film making was brought back into my purview. I began to study the benefits of crowd funding; this led me on a 4-year journey of study and reflection on the industry. Contrary to many people’s belief, the benefit of crowd funding is not the money in my opinion…IT IS without a doubt the community. There is a great article here in the Harvard Business Review that speaks to it better than I ever could: https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-unique-value-of-crowdfunding-is-not-money-its-community - This article impacted me greatly. It appeared that this new regulation not only gave fans a new opportunity that they never had before, it also solved many of the original issues that, in my opinion, had plagued the industry early in my film making career. The answer was the community. They are the end consumer, the most important part of the equation…the people who vote with their dollars, the people who are more passionate about some projects than the creators themselves at times…why would it not be beneficial to have them on the “team”. With nudging from God, I felt a calling to start Called Higher Studios. I believe that my background in both business and in film serve me in this venture. It is true, I have a very deep skill set in marketing as well, which in my opinion is the #1 asset that you can have when making and distributing a film. What you potentially see as a weakness, we view as our greatest asset. With that being said, we are committed to excellence and quality when it comes to filmmaking and content creation. Films are very similar to a real estate project, for each project you have the ability to hire the “right” and “most qualified” person for that individual project. It is our intention to surround ourselves with excellent screenwriters, producers, and directors with regards to each project…the right tool for each job. I should have clarified, just because Neil is listed as a screenwriter, it is false to assume that he is our one and only screenwriter who will work on every single project. Each project will be handled by industry professionals who are skilled at their craft, and whom management feels gives us the greatest opportunity for success.

Regarding Neil, he serves a very specific role at Called Higher Studios. I have worked with him previously, and I can say that he is one of the most talented, young screenwriters that I have come across. His attention to detail, research, and character development is unparalleled for someone his age and at this stage of his career. He graduated with a BA in Communications with an emphasis on Cinema and also holds a minor in Theater. You are correct, he held many jobs to work in the “industry” as he began to hone his craft, these include the jobs you listed, but at the same time he was always writing and improving. He currently has a story editor credit on a feature film that is in postproduction. He is in preparation to attend law school to gain his law degree in entertainment law so that he can continue to deepen his understanding of the industry. In my opinion, Neil is currently, and is going to be, a great asset. Called Higher Studios has many writing needs, from short form content, outlining, script reading, story development, and many additional writing needs just to name a few. Neil and Called Higher Studios mutually benefit from each other’s needs and skill sets. Neil assists us in story editing, outlining, and early stage script writing in preparation to further the project or engage other writers.

Alisha, I really appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions; it has given me an avenue to explain in more detail our team and what they have worked on. We do have a very distinct strategy and we are going to do our best to execute it. Thank you again for the question."

What is the potential revenue or an average of possible revenue from lets say one movie produce (hard question but I'm assuming there is an average or low/high side)? Again I love what you are trying to do but from a business side I'm definitely not confident on a concrete plan in place once you get the funding.","Hi Don, appreciate the comment. We're excited that you are excited about our end goals. Regarding the business side, we feel pretty strongly that our founders experience and track record of projects that they have worked on are strong foundations that could add positively to the growth and expansion of our company. I'll try to take each of your questions and answer them to the best of my ability. The number of films we can produce depends on our raise and what opportunities we have in front of us. We don't keep one production team on payroll, that would be fiscally expensive and irresponsible in our opinion, each project deserves the best people for that project...for that reason we will build teams around a certain project with regards to the above the line crew and talent, this keeps our overhead low during the pre-pro and development phases. Please read the Form C for more information on timeline for future projects. The potential revenue or average revenue is not something we can look at as a whole, each project is different and the market analysis of each film, it's target market, cast, etc all play into it. Lastly, I will say that we definitely have a plan in place to grow our company and expand it in a responsible way. Every opportunity that we have and objective is not listed on this site, as that would be very difficult to detail every single business objective and the path to achieve it. Thanks for the comment."

Called Higher Studios,https://www.startengine.com/called-higher-studios,Michael Walker,,No,2 months ago,"While getting my degree in film at Purdue I spent 3 years writing the story and the screenplay for an anti-bullying film, ""Religion"" isn't mentioned in it. ""Humanity"" and mans inhumanity to humanity IS. The script is 120 pages and if it doesn't make you cry you're not human. But, here's the thing it contains an anti-bully program that I feel is more than a Band-Aid for a bullet wound. In a nutshell, beginning in the fourth grade and continuing through high school students would have classroom discussion and reading materials regarding two bullying topics each month and throughout the entire school year which would be an added to the curriculum and graded effort, so it would be month after month and year after year all the way through high school. They would anonymously post to an online forum regarding each topic, preferably between school systems to maintain that anonymity, and then do a minimum of three peer reviews on what other students think and feel about the same subject matter. Once the peer reviews were in they would then go back to revisit their original post to see what others had to say about their initial thoughts before posting again as to why/why not their thoughts and feelings on each subject have/have not changed.
The idea is to raise a critical awareness within them and to also create a meaningful and lasting mindfulness about bullying, what it is, what it does, and what we can do about it. The topics would be relevant to their age brackets and older students might also be required to do one paper per semester on a bullying topic of their own choosing so as to help create a better, larger, and more diverse data supply on the subject which could then be used to help tweak the program. Given what could be gathered over time by this concept on the various topics and from the varying geographic and sociological components, I would think that the psychological, sociological, and anthropological sciences would have previously unavailable and also massive amounts of Big Data which would be unlike anything that currently exists on the subject – and all of it garnered from a body of students who have the kinds of insights that go beyond anything we currently have to work with, and which would be the most relatable to them.
4,600 children take their lives every year. For every student that does so 100 others attempt it. 160,000 children every day in this country are too terrified to go to school. What would Jesus do?","Hi Michael, while this is outside of our expertise and scope with regards to the curriculum, peer reviews, and class room portion...we support any project that aims to bring awareness to Christ and to deal with issues that our youth are facing today such as bullying.

Called Higher Studios,https://www.startengine.com/called-higher-studios,Marjorie Shorter,6,Yes,3 months ago,"I wasnt sure if you had listed any information such as this that i pulled off another start engine investment. Of course i know nothing is guaranteed, but do you have any such wording anywhere? This is pulled off the Kind Katie start engine information that closed a while ago, wasnt sure if i missed something In your information? Several investments I have seen similar wording, maybe your is different but i cant find it.

FROM KIND KATIE:
The Opportunity (Investment)

* 100% of the adjusted gross profit gets returned to you first.
* Once you've received 120% of your principal investment, then your return adjusts to a prorated share of 50% of net profits.""","Marjorie, that is a great question. I have not seen the Kind Katie investment page, so I am not 100% sure how they structured their raise, but it appears from your comment to be some type of profit sharing or debt mechanism paid back through net profit proceeds...so essentially profit sharing. Our raise is an equity raise, so you are purchasing stock in the company. You are correct, nothing is guaranteed, but as we operate and assuming we are successful then it may be in the company's best interest to pay out dividends to shareholders. While I do not believe there is currently a secondary market for Reg CF shares, I do believe that StartEngine is working on such a marketplace where the future possibility of trading stock that you purchased on StartEngine may exist in the future, providing you liquidity options and the potential to realize a profit. You could also potentially see an ROI from a merger, a sale of the company, or again through future possible dividends or distributions. Currently we do not have any of these planned, and we only put them here as examples of ways that you could potentially see a return. Our intention is to operate this company long term, and grow it into a stable and profitable venture for everyone involed. I hope that answers your question and thanks for the comment."

Great innovation to reduce the carbon footprint I would think.

thank you.","Thanks Steven, a lot of our customers have had this same question about cleaning. Generally, the solar oven is not screaming hot to burn or scatter grease while cooking, so there's very little mess. Our solar ovens cook at a speed that is equivalent to a typical oven at 350°F (177°C), so there is always some clean up but: 1) most of the food debris remains in the stainless steel cooking tray 2) inside larger ovens is cleaned by hand 3) to reach inside of smaller ovens they come with a scrub brush.

Thank you in advance.","How much runway will this raise provide?
This raise is about growth, since GoSun is generally meeting monthly expenses. The duration of this raise will depend on our future product success and the cost of R&D efforts. I would assume a few years before we raise further funding.

Who are your competitors?
We don’t consider many competitors in solar cooking; our main market comparisons are making consumer solar energy products like, Goal Zero and Biolite Energy. We also have a right to win market share with traditional consumer brands like Coleman, JetBoil and Yeti.

What is company's unfair advantage over the competitors?
GoSun is fast, nimble, and well connected.  When we see an opportunity, we take it. Indeed, there are other companies with more engineers and larger R&D budgets, but GoSun is fighting well above its weight when creating clean, innovative products that meet market needs. This kind of speed and tenacity can be seen in our current Kickstarter campaign which has pre-sold about $50K in one week.

How will you use the funds that you raise?
New capital invested in GoSun will support three main areas: 1) R&D, 2) product development and launch 3) marketing and sales efforts.  Established lean market roll out techniques (i.e. current Kickstarter) will help the company scale, expanding partnerships in the segments of emergency preparedness and off-grid living to further establish the brand and align GoSun’s product offering with the correct institutions and consumer base."

Thanks for the great questions, I applaud your investigation. I agree, even though there is a lot of information on the page, it would be difficult to answer these questions. So, I’m happy to make an attempt here, though we should not be adding info outside of what’s above already.
I’ll post an update with our financial numbers through Q3, 2019 in the future. Take a look at our recent Indiegogo GoSun Chill campaign to see our pre-sales on products we plan to ship.
This investment offering is all about fueling our growth (this is where I have to be careful with what I write). Combining our traction with a variety of new products and sales channels, we are led to believe that GoSun’s break out is near. In 2019, we rounded out our key products to include more consumer electronics. This has connected GoSun to a much larger consumer base, far beyond the solar oven that provided the initial fuel.
Regarding our IP, GoSun is the first to apply vacuum insulation over a cooking chamber, either with sunlight or traditional fuels, such as electricity. Our first product to use this breakthrough has recently shipped to about 1,000 customers. It enables cooking off-grid with electricity to be practical for the first time because our hybrid electric oven consumes one tenth of the power of traditional ovens. Utility patents surrounding our oven applications provide coverage here and in China.

Or, do you feel with the limited number of players building similarly styled vans (Pop Tops) on the same platform, there won’t be any supply constraints on the Ford Chassis?

PS As an owner of a 2003 VW MV Weekender, I think a rear facing jump seat (or two) would be a great option.","Great question! As a result of a lot of hard work, including our win of the ""Van Life"" category at the RV industry RVX show last March, we have direct access to high level executives within Ford. Based on conversations with these contacts and our experience ordering Transit chassis (including 2020s) to date, we do not expect any major availability problems in the medium term. To give a little perspective, Ford builds about 150,000 Transits each year, most of which are white cargo vans used for trades. Right now, we are seeing early production hiccups with our 2020 orders that include the cool new driving assistance features.

Do you still feel that a buyout is a real possibility with this information coming to light? Please help me understand why ModVans would be a smart investment given the history and confidence someone would have buying from Ford directly. What makes a ModVan better?

https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-nugget-tiny-home-built-inside-of-fords-transit-van-2019-10","Thanks for the great question! The Ford Nugget is not a new vehicle that is suddenly going to make problems for ModVans! It is a new version of an older vehicle that is only available in Europe. It is converted by a non-Ford conversion company using the European version of the smaller Ford Transit Connect. In Europe, this arrangement of a vehicle manufacturer, contracting out to a conversion company, then selling the converted vehicle through their dealer network is common. In the US, this would be very unusual. When you include commercial conversions (bucket trucks, panel trucks, ambulances, etc.) and RVs, there are thousands of US companies converting vehicles. In the US, Ford has done a really great job of supporting vehicle conversion companies, including RV manufactures, and leaving their markets alone. Although Ford contracts with a conversion company in Europe for the Nugget, I don’t imagine that they will bring this model to the US soon, if ever. And if, they ever do, there would surely be an opportunity for ModVans to apply for the contract.

On the Nugget conversion itself: There are actually two versions and we love them both! However, neither is modular and, though it is difficult to tell from the pictures online, they are both really small. The Nugget is built on the Ford Transit Connect. This is a much smaller vehicle than the Ford Transit. When you take a hard look at vehicle sales data in the US, while we believe that there is a niche for a smaller vehicle than the CV1, we firmly believe that the full-sized Transit, with available twin turbo EcoBoost engine and All Wheel Drive, was the right platform for our first vehicle. Based on feedback from prospects and customers, we also believe that our modular conversion, including optional seating for 7, is key to unlocking sales in the multipurpose vehicle market.

Regarding platform availability: Our designs, our design processes and a lot of our manufacturing are based on techniques such as 3D Scanning, 3D CAD, automated manufacturing of molds, automated cutting, etc.. While we only build on the Transit at this time, it would be relatively straightforward to switch to another chassis platform if necessary.

Regarding a Buyout: We believe a drastic change in the US market, like the hypothetical scenario of Ford building and selling small RVs directly in the US, would make it more likely for large companies to consider buying a small, nimble yet established company like ModVans - a hot market is is a hot market!"
ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Louis Ybarrondo,17,Yes,2 months ago,"PJ, congratulations on creating ModVans. It is a great project and there is quite a bit of room to grow. Are you planning on working with just with the Ford Transit, (Hopefully) or are you planning to branch out to other manufacturers? Also, how much does 4WD and a traditional steel bumper, such as those on the Ford E Series Vans add to the price? What are the different color options? Thank you.","Thanks for your support! We think the Ford Transit is the best chassis available by a wide margin, so we are sticking with it for the short term. Medium to long term, we are carefully watching new EV chassis platforms and making connections to those businesses as they develop.

All our pricing is online at https://www.modvans.com/cv1/pricing. We offer both 4x4, installed as an aftermarket conversion, and the new Transit AWD, available from Ford, as options on our website.

The Transit is a completely new chassis and doesn't have the same weight capacities as the E Series, so the situation with accessories is different. In 2019 and earlier, you had to watch front axle weight carefully, so, for the Transit, aluminum is the material of choice for front axle accessories to save weight. You can get an idea of pricing without installation for aluminum Transit accessories at https://www.aluminess.com/ and https://backwoodsadventuremods.com/. In 2020, the Transit adds a heavy duty front axle option, but we do not yet know how much additional weight can be added on the front. With most customers opting for AWD, which will add weight on the front axle for the AWD components, our guess is that aluminum will continue to be the material of choice for Transit accessories."

First, thank you for taking the lead and developing a fuel-efficient vehicle that can be used for both camping and every-day commute! This is a great idea that deserves support. Coming from Europe where gas is 4-times more expensive than in the US, I do appreciate this vehicle.
As a CPA, I'd like to know if you'll publish any financials and if you have any regulatory requirement to either perform a review or audit of your financial statements?","Thanks for your kind words and support! At the campaign launch, we were required to publish CPA reviewed financials. Our 2017 financials were published at that time.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,kedrin edwards,3,No,3 months ago,what happens if you don't reach your maximum goal of 1.07M?? what will our money be used for?,"Regulation Crowdfunding is still very new. When we setup our original timeline, given our sales, excellent financial condition and other factors, our plan called for us to raise the full RegCF amount within 3 months. Now that we have now learned a lot more about RegCF and how the fundraising process works, we see that the fundraising part of our timeline was unrealistic for our type of business. Last week, we updated our campaign video and posted several updates to our campaign page and have started to accelerate our fundraising. The results so far look good and we believe that we will be able to raise the full amount over the next few months.

In the meantime, this campaign has raised over $300k from over 600 investors! This is less than the full amount, but our production scaling plans are linear so, we have already put this money to work expanding our production capacity from 1 unit per month to 3 units per month by hiring new employees, buying tools and purchasing additional inventory. As explained in other comments below, in 2020, Ford added a factory All Wheel Drive (AWD) option to the Ford Transit van chassis we build on. This will be great for us - AWD is very popular (plus there are lots of other cool new options) - but we decided to carefully manage the number of 2019 chassis in the queue so we wouldn't end up getting stuck with difficult to sell 2019 chassis. As a result, currently, we are building 2 chassis per month until our first batch of 2020s arrive in January. We are taking this time and using some of the campaign money to improve our shop, tooling and processes.

We are still in good financial condition, are still delivering CV1s to happy customers as quickly as possible and still selling CV1s faster than we can produce them."

Anything that would add growth model with funding added features, since all want is take off on a solid foundation. You have a Marvelous design already.","Thanks for the investment and suggestions! We have applied to some government funding programs and are considering others. The government program applications can be large and complicated. The results take a long time and are very uncertain - so far, the only program we have been approved for is the SBA loan program. At some point in the future we will be large enough to attract and negotiate incentives directly with cities as many large manufactures do.

As far as I know, the government doesn't do a lot of manufacturing, but they use vendors and we are in contact with some of those vendors with plans to use some of their facilities for making molds and large scale composite parts. Working with vendors in general can be great way to quickly expand our capabilities with a minimal outlay of capital. On the other hand, many vendors are still stuck in the past and are slow."

Everyone investor interested in the company wants to see upping production issues addressed soonest.","By ""counterpart production outlet"", I think you mean franchising other companies to build and/or sell ModVans. We've talked to a couple of related businesses about franchising. The way we setup our supply chain and make parts via a CNC Router, it would be technically possible. A major challenge right now is that it takes a fair amount of skill and training to bring a new assembly or parts team member up to speed. Currently, we are using all our manpower for production and in-house growth. When we get the money we need to scale, we will need to use all our training resources in-house. If we got to a place where we could free up our team to train franchisees, then we would need to tackle the other challenges: how to find and sell to franchisees, how to make sure they are properly capitalized and staffed, how to protect our designs and other intellectual property (IP), how to ensure consistent quality, how they purchase chassis (our wholesale chassis agreements are non-transferable) and developing a franchise profit model. The business model behind franchising is quite a bit different than manufacturing. While we are in the startup phase with limited resources and a year long order backlog, maintaining focus is important."
ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,kedrin edwards,3,No,4 months ago,do you guys plan on paying dividends in the future??,"ROI for Investors

Any time between now and about a year from now, there could be a simple exit with an early stage buyout. The early stage Airstream acquisition of Nest is a related example. In this case, investors would ideally net a small return that would, ideally, greatly outperform a similar investment in index funds.

If no exit transpires over the next year, will continue to add production capacity as planned. When we reach 10 RVs/month, we believe we will have a $50 million company and plan to raise a Series A round to build a factory with higher levels of automation and much higher production capacity. Depending on the investors, a Series A round may provide an exit opportunity for early stage investors. Alternatively, an exit via acquisition at this stage would ideally give investors a 5-10x return. The Winnebago acquisition of Grand Design for $500m is a related example.

With the money from Series A, we anticipate ramping production and building out our product line for the next year (2 years total) , to the levels necessary for either a small IPO, or, if demand continues to greatly outpace production capacity (a likely outcome), to raise a Series B round. The Series B round would build enough production capacity to make us a true vehicle manufacturer and lead to a large IPO, ideally within 2 more years (3-5 years total) and a ""unicorn"" (30x) level returns for investors.

In addition to the above traditional return possibilities, we believe the Regulation Crowdfunding movement (which is still new) will push entities such as StartEngine (our RegCF platform host) to offer easy to use market based trading opportunities in small Online Public Offering (OPO) shares (subject to the 12 month SEC rule) for our investors in the near future.

Like most early stage, high growth companies (such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook in their early days), we do not plan to pay out dividends any time in the near future. All profits will be reinvested into growth."

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,SJ Phillips,,No,a year ago,"@PJ Tezza, Thanks for your response. I don't see a way to reply ""in thread"" so I'll just post again here. (Sorry for the delay by the way -- I've been traveling.)

For the record, I am not a CPA either. I do hope your accountant doesn't put $3.3 million down as 2018's revenue on your tax return though. :-)

At any rate, that's all secondary and I only mentioned it earlier because I wish the best for your crowdsourced investment attempt. I'm somewhat familiar with the strains of demand massively outstripping production capability, and given the ""emphasizing the positive"" nature of how sales / revenue / cash flow were presented above, it took me a bit to sort out that that was the situation at hand.

Again, though, let me reiterate how impressive it is, what you have accomplished so far, particularly on the production end.

I believe your pricing has changed a few times, but back-of-the-napkin arithmetic = you've got committed orders for somewhere around 40-50 units. May I ask how many have been shipped so far?

More importantly, can you give any sense for what you mean by ""a reasonable amount of time"" in your previous answer? I know much remains unforeseen and unforeseeable, but are you thinking... four years? (i.e. like Grand Design) ...ten years? ...twenty years? I guess I'm wondering if you've got some kind of ""cash out, or pay some dividends"" line drawn out there in the future somewhere. It's reasonably likely that we'll invest something in ModVans, but whether that is a $100-$1000 lottery ticket or a much more significant amount depends largely on ""timeline to some sort of return"" expectations.

Lastly, you mention intellectual property in your answer to Curt Brom below. Though I think you do have some current advantages with regard to his concern and question, I'm having a hard time seeing much that's protectable in terms of patents, trademarks, or copyrights with the van itself. MAYBE some very limited design patents (the roof shape?), but I certainly don't see any utility patents in it, and copyrighting is completely irrelevant. I'm assuming you've filed for trademark protection of the ModVan name and mark (though that isn't indicated near either one, in use). But... what else is protected, or could be protected, in terms of ""intellectual property""?","No problem - happy to have the conversation and thanks again for the kind words. We are around 40 committed orders (with a few more in the reservation queue) and 10 deliveries. We are about to deliver our first 4x4, which will be a nice milestone. After that we have 3 more 4x4 builds coming up, 2 of which will be ""spikey."" The current 2WD CV1s deliberately appear mainstream, as that best fits our biggest target market. A more aggressive look (big bumpers, winches, tires, etc.), will help us build more brand awareness and these builds will be here soon.

I apologize for being vague about the timeline. I will try to lay out our ideas here in more detail. Any time between now and about a year from now, there could be a simple exit with an early stage buyout. The early stage Airstream acquisition of Nest is a related example. We have kept low on the RV industry radar, but this investment campaign is raising awareness. In the last couple of weeks, I've been cold called by an RV dealer and a Ford dealer to form partnerships and a very wealthy individual for investment opportunity, so there is potential interest. In March we will be taking a 4x4 CV1 to the RVX RV industry trade show in Salt Lake City. Here, we will get our first major exposure to the full RV industry with, I believe, possibilities for partnerships or exits.

If no exit transpires over the next year, will continue to add production capacity as planned. When we reach 10 RVs/month, we believe we will have a $50 million company and plan to raise a Series A round to build a factory with higher levels of automation and much higher production capacity. Depending on the investors, a Series A round may provide an exit opportunity for early stage investors. Alternatively, an exit via acquisition at this stage should give investors a 5x return. With the money from Series A, we anticipate ramping production and building out our product line for the next year (2 years total) , to the levels necessary for either a small IPO, or, if demand continues to greatly outpace production capacity (a likely outcome), a to raise a Series B round. The Series B round would build enough production capacity to make us a true vehicle manufacturer and lead to a large IPO, ideally within 2 more years (3-5 years total) and a ""unicorn"" level final return for investors (our TAM is $900 billion!).

In addition to the above traditional return possibilities, I believe the Regulation Crowdfunding movement (which is still new) will push entities such as StartEngine to offer easy to use market based trading opportunities in small OPO shares (subject to the 12 month SEC rule) for our investors in the near future.

In addition to design patent and trademarks, we also have a large and growing number of CAD and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) programs we use to make our molds and cut parts with CNC routers, mills and lathes. Ultimately, access to these designs and programs is what a competitor (or acquirer) would need to duplicate our parts without having to put in the R&D effort (except maybe to copy the dimensions with a 3D scanner, but then they are still a long way from making parts).

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Curt Bromm,4,No,a year ago,What's stopping another company that is better capitalized coming along and doing the same thing??,"In software and SAAS businesses, the barriers to entry are low. Any new business (like Facebook), that sees an idea (like MySpace), only needs a few smart guys with laptops to build something similar in a short amount of time. In contrast, ModVans is more than just an idea and some computer code. Even with an amazing team like the one that started ModVans and all the luck, building a competitive RV with similar design, materials, licenses and certifications is going to take a substantial amount of money and time. In the meantime, we won’t be just waiting for them to catch up! Anybody making a clone of the CV1 risks infringing on our intellectual property.

Large RV manufacturers such as Winnebago have finally noticed the Class B “adventure van” market. However, they are, IMO, still stuck thinking Class B RVs are just for two people. The Winnebago Revel is cool looking and targeted directly at “adventure couples,” but it costs $150,000 and only has safe and comfortable seating for 2 adults – it is not a family friendly cross over vehicle like the CV1. It doesn’t have removable components, so it isn’t easy to use for work. Large RV manufactures will eventually notice the success of the CV1, but when they do, they will have a long period of R&D ahead of them and a lot of big company overhead to overcome. Instead of taking the risk of a large, new R&D project in an unfamiliar market and infringing on our intellectual property, a smart RV manufacturer will make us an offer to buy the company that we can’t refuse.

That question asked, kudos on your quick learning. I've been involved enough in both the software and manufacturing industries to appreciate the learning curve of your journey from the former to the latter. Impressive!

Last thought: you might consider using the more accurate word ""orders"" rather than ""sales"" when referring to van order contracts yet to be fulfilled.

If, for some reason, a compatible exit for investors doesn't materialize within a reasonable amount of time, we will adjust our strategy accordingly - the same team that took us from concept to production to product/market fit is the same team that will be leading ModVans to a return for our investors.

We are not CPAs. Our Form C for this campaign, which includes our financial statements that classify various financial transactions, has been reviewed by two different legal teams and our CPA. According to our CPA, because we have signed contracts and deposits for each ""sale"" and a high likelihood of collecting payment, we should recognize these transactions as revenue. As a CEO for a high growth startup, my initial goal was to find product/market fit. IMO, this is demonstrated by the number of people willing to commit, via signed contracts and deposits, to purchase a CV1 at a given price point - a number that we currently represent by $3.3 million in ""sales"". Now that we have, IMO, demonstrated product/market fit, my focus is on growing production as quickly as possible, without jeopardizing the overall business, so we can get to the next major inflection point.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Nathan Bendall,,No,a year ago,"Hi PJ. Thanks so much for your very thorough explanation on the costs to build the ModVan! My dad and I went on a road trip all the way from the Midwest to Ventura, CA last year. I think the Modvan will do great in sales due to the extreme costs of real estate in SoCal. Houses there easily can cost a Million Dollars or more. Will the extreme increase in homeless there hurt your customers who want to use the Modvan for traveling in SoCal? My dad and I were totally surprised of all the work that is going to make homeless people (and travelers) not welcome in SoCal. There were locks on the stores restroom doors. No parking was allowed overnight. There were no public restrooms to use except the ones at the beach. I wonder where would be a good place for a traveler to park their ModVan in Ventura, CA. and the rest of SoCal? Camping sites are hard to find there. I think that someone would have to buy or rent a small plot of land to park their ModVan on to have a place to stay there. I also want to say thank you for your help getting Ventura back on its feet after the wildfires. #We are Ventura Strong!","There are quite a few places to camp within a 45 minute drive of Ventura, including several spots on the ocean. The CV1 does well really here because there are several camping places nearby that only allow RVs (because there is no water or toilets), but have a few parking spots that are too small for large or even medium sized RVs. As a beach town in SoCal, camping on the ocean is competitive (worst on popular holidays), but there are times of year that you can easily get a site at multiple campgrounds and, for busy times, there are campgrounds that reserve spots for walk-ins (it helps to know all the rules for waiting and to show up early).

A campground is the only legitimate way to camp on the ocean in Ventura, and, the ocean campgrounds are relatively expensive and often competitive, but I think that is appropriate given the value of the underlying resource. If you are willing to drive just a little off the coast, there are campgrounds and even free dispersed camping in the nearby mountains.

I can't get political here, but, I have lived in Atlanta, SF Bay Area and now Ventura and volunteered in shelters and other venues in all 3 places. On the coast of CA, things are competitive and complicated because that is where so many people want to be. In the interior of CA there beautiful places with millions of acres of free dispersed camping we can visit without having to deal with so much overhead. When I'm camping, I tend to alternate between the two - we'll visit the ocean and put up with the rules, then go to the high desert where we can pretty much do as we please.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Nathan Bendall,,No,a year ago,"Hi! I like the flexibility of the modvan. It would be easy for me to drive down the street. I am currently a Millennial who is University Educated. The modvan's purpose is to drive to work during the week and go on road trips during the weekend. However, the MSRP of the modvan at $80,000 USD which seems kind of steep to me! A Brand New Ford Van costs around $35,000-$40,000. So what are the biggest expenses to build it? The Ford Van? Labor? Office Rent in SoCal? I have work at my local campground. I have seen a lot of RVs that are way overpriced with no quality at all that fall apart after a few years. Most Millennials including myself want to move out of our parents houses. A lot of us have student loan debt. We want a place to call our own. We don't want to go further into debt buying a large house. We want the ability to explore our country. I have heard of people who turn school buses into micro houses on wheels. I lack the ability and knowledge to build anything with my two hands. Maybe later modvans could explore the possibility of helping people to turn their dreams of micro houses on wheels into reality? School Bus turned into Loft on Wheels - Tiny House https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUYryxKfrUc Thanks for your time! I hope you have a good day!","Thanks for your feedback. Pricing is an important issue. We could have a lower price point with a less expensive base vehicle (ProMaster, used vans, etc.), less expensive components or less expensive to build design. What we decided instead was to build the RV that we would want: The best driving base van, an awesome popup top, modular design (including components mounted under the van to save space), the best components and materials we could buy, plus a feature complete conversion with a furnace, A/C, plumbing, etc.. By staying lean and using modern manufacturing techniques, we've managed to have a price lower than our competitors (see the analysis above).

In addition to having a lower price (for a feature complete camper van with a popup top) than our competitors, we help customers afford the CV1 by building a modular RV that can also serve as a daily vehicle so they can save the costs associated with a owning a separate vehicle for camping. RV financing, RV insurance and potential tax savings, also help customers afford the CV1 when compared with owning a non-RV vehicle (or a camper van built by a company that can't offer RV financing).

The fact that this is a winning combination, at least for some families, is evidenced by $3.3 million in sales in our first 16 months (many made with a 12+ month long wait list).

We understand that, even with RV financing, our choices and pricing are not affordable for all budgets. We hope that as we increase production and become more sophisticated in our manufacturing, we will be able to eventually lower prices and offer more affordable models.

To answer your specific questions about cost drivers, by far, the most expensive individual component in the CV1, both in terms of materials and labor, is the popup top. It is big and beautiful, but it is expensive. The second most expensive part is our awesome and unique furnace / water heater that we mount under the van floor in a custom aluminum enclosure. Number three is the stainless steel refrigerator. For each of these 3 major components and others, there are indeed ways to cut costs, but the result would be a noticeably inferior product.

It is more expensive to manufacture in Ventura, California than Forest City, Iowa, but Ventura is a great location for ModVans. Because of our automation and class B RV design, labor, the item with the biggest potential cost savings in a more remote location, is a smaller percentage of our costs than for a more traditional RV manufacturer. Housing in the Ventura area is some of the most affordable near the cost in California, yet we are close enough to LA to take advantage of its large manufacturing infrastructure. We are also close to the largest camper van sales market in the world – LA and San Diego. Ventura is near several major airports, including LAX, with affordable, non-stop flights to anywhere in the USA. The city and county of Ventura are encouraging and supportive of high quality employers like ModVans, and property and buildings zoned for industrial use are readily available for purchase and lease.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Margaret Deavours,,Yes,a year ago,"I have just invested and hope to eventually be an owner! I would like to know exactly how the modules, seats, etc are removed? It states in several places they are easy to remove to convert to an everyday passenger van or hauler. Perhaps a video showing this would be helpful? also, how much space does it take to store these items when not in use? I love the idea of the versatility, but realistically is it really that easy to convert? Thanks, Margaret","Thanks so much for investing and we look forward to having you as a customer! How much space to store the modules depends on which modules. I'd estimate that you could store all the cabinets, the beds and the 2nd row seats in about 30 square feet. The most commonly removed modules are the driver side storage cabinet - approximately 1.5'x4' and the 2nd row seats - approximately 2'x6'.

The bed panels and cushions friction fit, so they are easy to take in and out. The toilet removes with a latch. The rest of the modules and 2nd row seats are bolted in place with removable bolts. We tried to make the bolts relatively easy to access and operate. Some items, such as the 2nd row seats and passenger side storage cabinet (which has the fridge), are heavy enough that 2 people may be required. For specific details on how to install and/or remove each component, please contact ModVans directly.

We prioritized making the most important items, such as the beds and toilet, easy to convert. Other items, such as the kitchen cabinet are more time consuming, but still possible by a typical person with a socket and wrench set. Beyond versatility, there are two additional benefits to our modular design:

1) To make the modular design work, we mounted major components, such as the furnace, propane tank, inverter and batteries under the van. Not only does this enable the modular design, but is also saves precious space inside the van.
2) We are in the process of designing new modules that we can offer new and existing customers.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Tom Jones,,No,a year ago,"$9 Billion is a big number. What comprises the $900 Billion estimate? New vehicles only or all automotive expenditure across the accessory, repair and maintenance market? Which firm did your valuation work?","Thanks for your interest in ModVans! The $900 Billion Total Addressable Market Size Projection is computed by taking the total number of minivans, pickup trucks, SUVs and Class B RVs sold in 2017 and multiplying by our average sale price of $86,000. The ""average sale price"" is computed by taking our total first year sales and dividing by the number of sales.

ModVans,https://www.startengine.com/modvans,Tom Jones,,No,a year ago,What's the total lifetime cost of the vehicle if I do the 20-year loan? How does that compare to a Sienna? Can your (our) customers reasonably expect a CV1 to last the length of the loan if it's a daily driver?,"We designed our conversion to last at least 20 years. The transit chassis should easily go 250,000 miles (my family put well over that on an Econoline that we sold to another family), so that works out 12,500 miles per year. The average american puts 12,000 miles per year on their car, so we believe that 20 years is reasonable.

RV loans are available with a range of terms, so you could, for example, use a 10 year loan and, with the savings from RV insurance and 2nd mortgage interest write-off, still pay less on a monthly basis than for a well equipped minivan.

When you pay a loan off over a longer term, you will pay more, overall, in interest. You'd have to say how long you plan to own each vehicle, how much you can save with RV insurance and 2nd mortgage interest write-off and how many miles you plan to drive (the minivan will get better gas mileage) to estimate which option would cost the least in total. In the example on our website, we assume that you save $472/month on the vehicle. For 12,000 miles per year, the MPG difference works out to about $50/month. Let's assume that you buy a new minivan every 7 years vs. keep your CV1 all 20. In this case, you save $422/month for 20 years - $8,440 with a CV1 (though you'd be driving a 6 year old minivan vs. a 20 year old CV1 at the end).

We originally had everything setup to work out to even dollar amounts, but, it turns out that the stock price has to be calculated on a ""fully diluted basis."" In part, this means that the incentive pool of stock we have authorized, but with no shares yet issued, has to be included when calculating to the stock price (technically, when presenting the pre-money valuation to investors). This change led to a price per share of $5.95. More rules say, you can only buy even numbers of shares and 17x$5.95=$101.15 was as close to $100 as we could get (without changing our valuation, which I didn't want to do).

5. What is the current annual production?","Hi BB - Thank you for your interest. While I’m not in the position to provide sensitive numbers in this forum, I'll try and address the gist of your questions below:

ETI / MDT AGREEMENT:
• Long-term agreement with automatic renewals.
• Provides ETI exclusive distribution and naming rights to all markets outside Mexico. Any new importers, distributors or subsidiaries / JV's or usage of the El Tinieblo name (or any other brand from MDT) within the territory will be under ETI.
• MDT’s pricing is close to cost and very favorable to ETI, providing us with a competitive edge when it comes to margin.
• While pricing can be renegotiated on an annual basis, any increase would be tied to the US Consumer Pricing Index, should the parties be unable to agree.
• Outside of typical provisions, MDT may only terminate if mutually agreed upon annual sales goals are not met for three consecutive years.

PRODUCTION SCALABILITY:
• Rancho El Tinieblo contains over 1M agave plants and 25 new ones are planted for every one used.
• Though the ranch already had sufficient capacity, they have just added two additional stills in anticipation of even more volume in the future.
• The ranch can increase volume 15x without improvements.
• Plans to upgrade the facility to handle even more volume and increase efficiency, including architectural drawings, are in development."

Could you e-mail a list and cost of some of your super foods? edlovesdebi3@yahoo.com. Thank you. Lawrence Collins","Hi Lawrence, we are a direct consumer, online company. All Bōku products are available directly on our website from which we capture orders and ship to customers in 65 countries worldwide.
www.bokusuperfood.com
We chose this model and to avoid traditional retail when we started the company back in 2007. I have decades of experience in direct consumer marketing but also leading our decision is the ability to offer the highest quality ingredients at competitive prices. Because we sell direct, the customer does not have to absorb jobber fees, broker fees, slotting fees, ad allowances and other costs that drive prices up in retail stores.

We also like the cash flow dynamics and ability to maintain direct relationships and communication with our customers.

We have historically acquired customers through word of mouth by providing industry leading products and unparalleled customer experiences. We are now also embarking on aggressive strategic digital marketing campaigns leveraging Facebook, Instagram, Google, etc.

Thanks for sharing. We are aware of the Japanese meaning. To us Bōku means “love life”. Please feel free to visit our site to see all Bōku products. Hope this helps and that you elect to invest in Bōku whole the shares are only .50 each!

I am interested in your company I just have a few questions.
After 12 years why are your products still only available online. Do you plan on selling through distributors or in retail stores other than your own? Also what are the gross sales annually after 12 years in business? Thank you","Hi Brad, Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling like crazy.
We intentionally built Boku as a direct to consumer company and have never pursued retail distribution for a variety of reasons. Here are a few: 1. This is an area of expertise for me going back to 1994 when I co-founded a joint venture partnership with Home Shopping Network. 2. By selling directly, we can offer our customers the absolute highest quality products at value pricing because we don't expose them to outrageous mark-ups to include brokers, jobbers, ad allowances, etc. 3. The cash flow dynamics are very attractive. We do not have receivables. Boku is paid the minute goods leave our warehouse. As you probably know, often with retailers, payment is very slow and by the time they deduct fees, penalties, allowances, etc., brands are often left chasing what's left of their invoice for months. 4. We love the direct connection with our customers. Wholefoods as an example may have millions of customers, but would be hard pressed to name one of them. We have direct access to 100% of our customers and communicate with them regularly. This open line of direct communication is invaluable for optimizing the customer and brand experience. All this said, we are not ruling out potential retail distribution as we continue to grow, especially for our forthcoming Pet superfood range and other specialty items.

Our trailing 12 months revenue number is approximately $1 million. This number was much higher while we were selling on TV but margins were much lower and we did not control recurring revenue. This may all change as the TV network is currently courting us to return. Lots of detail that I'm happy to fill in if needed. Please feel free to reach me directly via cell at 805-252-9962

Thanks for your interest in Bōku. There are so many things that separate us from other superfood companies, it’s hard to list.
1. Authenticity. We’re not in the business because it’s trendy. Our lives were transformed by superfoods going back 25 years and we have an unrelenting commitment to sharing.
2. Our formulas have disrupted and led the industry since we started back in 2007. We are not the biggest (yet) but the biggest have been copying us since we started.
3. Our Brand. We have focused intensely on delivering the absolute best products and customer experiences possible with our goal to build a brand. We have worked very hard for 14 years building the foundation from which we are now ready to grow. This disciplined approach has us on a long term path to outgrow and outlast the competition.

If when is ready to be market for other retailers to sell could i do so as well and if so how will that work me been an investor on the company?","Hi Ainere,
Thanks for asking! Several opportunities for return on investment. On the the StartEngine secondary platform, you will have the ability to sell your shares after holding them for the statutory one year period. We may also be acquired by a much larger company. This would likely occur at a valuation higher than .50 per share and you would benefit from that difference in sale price. We may also elect to pay dividends as you point out. Yes, we may very well pursue retail distribution depending on your business, that could certainly be a possibility. Not sure what those terms would be and how they might differ for shareholders. Certainly something worth exploring/discussing. Please feel free to reach me directly if you have additional questions.

Boku International,https://www.startengine.com/boku-international-inc,Luke Bullinger,4,No,7 months ago,"Good evening!

I am hoping you can answer a few questions for me.

What is the state of the deal of integrating Boku Superfoods into the Google facility? Is there an estimated scope or impact to sales to come from a partnership with Google?

What competitive advantage sets Boku apart from other companies in the superfood markets?

From reading your overview and your key elements, as well as cost of goods in the annual reports, it is clear that quality is a premium and Boku is adamant regarding retention of quality (rightly so!). Is there a directive or other path being explored to reduce cost in order to make entrance to retailers more feasible?","Hi Luke,
Please pardon my delay as I have been traveling extensively.

First, thank you for your interest in Boku!
We have been working with Google (and LinkedIn) for some time now and are scheduled to present in late August at Google’s Kirkland WA Campus. This is part of a large corporate wellness strategy we are launching that will eventually include large and small companies all over the world. A key element is the disruptive new packaging we are developing called “Shake & Take”. This is a plastic pouch that comes pre-loaded with Boku powder and an agitator ball. The end user need only add pure water, shake and take for a nutrient dense superfood meal replacement.

We have been testing these pouches in recyclable plastic but will ultimately launch with a fully compostable hemp biofilm so the pouch can be discarded with absolutely no negative environmental impact. In addition to our corporate wellness initiative, this packaging will also open several new sales channels availing us access to many underserved market segments including;
Schools, hospitals, assisted living facilities, airports, military, first responders and possibly conventional retail, which we have purposely avoided since inception.

Different from when we launched in 2007, there are actually several great superfood products on the market. That said, we take enormous pride in being the absolute best. In addition to our industry leading quality, taste, purity and innovation, I would say the one thing that sets Boku apart is our authenticity. We are not in this business because its trendy. We discovered superfoods nearly 25 years ago in a quest to find an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs for our young son. Superfoods made a huge difference in our lives and ignited a passion in us to share these gifts and healing experiences with others. We have also worked extremely hard with a disciplined, long term focus on building our brand. We have not had an exit strategy as much as a purpose and commitment strategy. As a result of this commitment, we now have 5-star Google reviews and a loyal following that modestly spans 65 countries.

COGs could reduce based on volume as we grow. I do believe though that our extreme quality and doctor formulated blends will keep Boku positioned as a higher-end superfood brand. What I believe might set us apart at retail is our new “Shake & Take” packaging and innovative formulas. We are also diving deeply into the hemp superfood space. Boku has recently filed a patent application on a new process for decarboxylating cannabinoids in hemp, without heat. This is incredibly exciting and potentially disruptive. The range of hemp fortified superfood blends could also be a big hit at retail, along with pet superfoods, personal care products and others.

I sincerely hope this helps!

Best,
Reno

Just that from inception, we have focused intensely on building our brand and not on exiting. Our strategy has always been long term and on our mission to positively impact people by sharing the healing gift of superfoods. As mentioned in that prior response, ours has been more a strategy of purpose and commitment than exit.

Now that we have 12 solid years under our belt with our product and process dialed in, we are prepared to scale. Our efforts to raise money conventionally were leading us to bankers and investors that did not align with our mission. Through StartEngine, we have been able to offer shares of Boku to friends, family and customers who know and believe in us. This has also led to potential large scale investors that also share our vision. As we endeavor to enter this next chapter of growth with these additional shareholders onboard, naturally our focus will expand to include potential exit strategies including possible acquisition, mergers, etc. Hope this helps!

Quick clarifying question:

Yes of course! This is based conservatively on average revenue per transaction of $100 and average turns (re-orders) of 3 per customer. This equates to a lifetime value of $300 but again is very conservative."
Boku International,https://www.startengine.com/boku-international-inc,Harish Asar,11,Yes,9 months ago,"Hi,
Who are your main competitors, do you have an exit plan. Are your products available in the top ten retail outlets.","Hi Harish,
1. There are numerous competitive superfood products on the market, including; Dr. Schultz, Amazing Grass, Aloha, Huel, Laird Superfood, Sun Warrior, Vitamineral greens and many others. That stated, we view major processed food, fast food, industrial farming and pharmaceutical companies as our true competition. These are the large corporations chiefly responsible for the adulteration of our food supply and the declining health of both consumers and our planet.

2. We have operated since inception under more of a purpose and commitment strategy and have not focussed on exiting until recently. We believe that through our unwavering commitment to creating the world's leading superfood products and unrivaled customer experiences, we would build a brand and that one day Boku would be an attractive target for acquisition by a like-minded group that SHARES OUR CORE VALUES AND ALIGNS WITH OUR MISSION.

3. We do not sell in retail anywhere. We have operated as a direct consumer company from inception. The only retail store in the world that carries Boku is at our HQ in Ojai, CA. It's quite possible that this model will change and our products will make there way to conventional retail outlets, now having benefited from more than 12 years of consumer awareness and brand building. There is also the potential for retail distribution of our pet super food, hemp and personal care products.

I hope this helps!

Boku International,https://www.startengine.com/boku-international-inc,Harold Tan,2,No,a year ago,"Can you explain why you're operating at a loss, and how many years the company has operated at a loss?","Hi Harold,
Sorry for the late reply! We exited a very difficult partnership with a major TV shopping network at the end of 2017. This difficult relationship saw among other damages, the migration of nearly 50% of our auto delivery customers away from our system and into the TV network customer base. The network tendered an offer to buy our company but we realized that we would not be able to control the quality of our products and that our brand would be watered down and eventually destroyed. As part of the deal we were negotiating, we were to build studio facilities here in Ojai, so we began the process of acquiring our new two acre facility and renovating the property to include studio facilities. This came at great expense to us and our overhead basically doubled, which added to the severity of our financial condition. We met as a family and elected to pull the plug, in order to save our brand and honor our commitment to being the best.

Lots of good came from the 300 + hours of live television exposure, but this situation hurt us terribly and caused pretty severe losses. While our gross revenue increased significantly in 2015, we lost money for the first time in our history the following year. The good news is, we are rebounding quite nicely and focused now on our core, direct consumer business and sustainable customer acquisition. I realize this may not be a complete explanation.

Boku International,https://www.startengine.com/boku-international-inc,Aaron Cantrell,10,Yes,a year ago,"I really like your products, I've been using them for a while. But for investing with you I am not sure how we'd ever make a return. You issue 10.7 million shares of stock at $0.000001 par value per share. And for the offering, you are selling the stock for .50 cents (and only 20-214k shares) - that is 500,000 times the value other stock is issued at. And you have a net operating loss. How will stock value be determined after this offering is closed? How would we see a return and what would that look like?","Hi Aaron,
Par value is a per share amount appearing on stock certificates. The par value of stock has no relation to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic.
In accounting, the par value allows the company to put a de minimis value for the stock on the company's financial statement. Par value is also used to calculate legal capital or share capital.
In jurisdictions where par values are used, most common stocks issued today have extremely low par values (often the smallest unit of currency in circulation such as $0.10 or $0.01 or $0.001) and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is the common stock's legal capital and it is part of the corporation's paid-in capital for example a penny (0.01) par value on a stock issued at USD $25.00/share.
The par value of a stock may affect its tax treatment. For example, In Delaware by choosing to assign a par value, a corporation may significantly reduce its franchise tax liability.
In our case, the earliest stock issuance to the founders in 2007 was at a nominal amount as we were just starting the company and we were working to invest our time and money to build the business. Since then we have raised additional capital at prices, most recently at $0.25/share in 2016.
While we are operating at a net loss currently, the reason we are raising capital is to now build the business and revenue base. We feel that now is the time for us to focus on marketing to reach a much wider audience for our products. We have built the company with almost no actual marketing spend, primarily word-of-mouth and grass roots marketing. We have also been developing other products such as our pet line we plan to launch, and this offering allows us to devote resources on this.
Hope this helps and addresses your question satisfactorily. Please let us know and thanks so much for your support!"

In a world full of negativity, I thought I would send you and your team a quick note to say how excited I am to be a part of PlantSnap! This app is literally the kind of thing (ie, THE thing) I dreamed of as a kid … “If only there was a way to just know what this flower is … Oh, or, what that flower over there is. Sigh, maybe someday in the future.”

Imagine my surprise when I first read about PlantSnap, did a little research, watched the video (Hey, Eric’s brother!) and decided I needed PlantSnap in my life. In the past few years, it has been awesome to see how the app has matured, expanded and continued to push the boundaries of a truly awesome use of technology for non-technological interests. Due to circumstances at the time, I wasn’t able to be a part of the first StartEngine campaign (wayyy back), so I am beyond stoked to have had another chance to invest – even just a little bit – into a group of awesome people working on an amazing suite of products.

Looking forward to what comes next!

You motivate us to get up every morning, make PlantSnap better, and help make the world a better place by bringing the beauty and wonder of nature into people's lives through technology. Thank you for being a part of the PlantSnap Community!"
PlantSnap Incorporated,https://www.startengine.com/plantsnap-inc,J O,,No,a month ago,"Just noticed Eric, you are in fact the FOUNDER. Not even an ill-informed member of staff. You should certainly know better.
Disgusting to be posting your investors personal data to name and shame them, and will most certainly be a breach of ToS.
Perhaps it is you, Eric, who need to do research and educate yourself on how business works. Something you are ironically telling other people to do.
I hope Thomas does get his money back, as you graciously accused him of not being interested in investing after doxxing him. Thomas, take the money and run because Eric clearly has no business acumen and choses not to keep his investors personal data safe.","Hi JO! If a person disparages PlantSnap in a public forum and does so by lying, we will always expose the lie by posting evidence that backs up our claim. Open a dictionary and look up the definitions of the words ""slander"" and ""libel"" then get back to us.
We wish you a happy and prosperous 2020!

PlantSnap Incorporated,https://www.startengine.com/plantsnap-inc,J O,,No,a month ago,"Since you chose to copy paste an answer you previously gave most other people and ignored my question, I will ask again.

Sending emails out to all of your plantsnap users urging them to invest because your are in financial trouble, without prior consent is not appropriate. Did you consider the repurcussions of this blatant missuse of your customers private and personal information for your own personal gain. Do you know the implications, fines and penalties for miss-using this data? Have you worked that into your business model too?

Also, your response to Thomas accusing him of lying, and posting a screenshot with his senstivie personal information, email address, location and associated name was extremely unprofessional as well as a further data breach. This is highly inappropriate and unethical and I hope Thomas files a formal complaint against you.

As you said, why would an investor bother to lie on a public page? They wouldn't. Instead of calling him a liar and doxxing his information to shame him, if you were a reputable company you'd get in touch and offer him the perk he was promised and look into why your company told him he wasn't entitled to the perk he was promised.

I see other previous investors have commented saying they didn't get the free app either, and that they are still waiting for their SAFES to be converted to shares, a question you didn't want to answer here because you said it was inappropriate to post on a public form. Yet you feel it is appropriate to doxx one of your investors on this public page?

All I can say is who would want to invest in a company who won't even keep their personal data secure.
I hope that the poor people you've lured onto this page by using their private and personal data unethically are reading these comments, seeing that you have no regard for your investors privacy and personal information, unprofessional comments, and taking your claims and valuations with a pinch of salt.

Whoever in your team is posting your investors personal data on a public form should be sacked, and let it be a warning to anyone looking to invest, the kind of unprofessional relationship, data protection breach and dirty tactics they can expect from you.","Hello JO! There are so many absurd statements in this post i'm not going to take the time to respond to them. Startups grow by raising money through stock offerings. Name any company you can think of, and i'll show you all of the funding rounds they had as they grew into massive corporations. Educate yourself, then contact me directly through the company website. You can record the phone call and post it for the world if you like.

PlantSnap Incorporated,https://www.startengine.com/plantsnap-inc,Tarun Eldho Alias,13,No,a month ago,I'm able to identify most plants with Google lens which is now integrated into Google app. How is your technology different?,"Hi Tarun! Google Lens is a ""macro"" image recognition platform. PlantSnap, and all of our present and future apps, are ""micro"" image recognition platforms. For example...PlantSnap focuses ONLY on plants and getting the correct species or subspecies correct, then giving you information inside the app about that plant, then allowing you to do many other things with that photo inside of the app without going to the web. If you point PlantSnap at a lamp, it would have no idea that the lamp was not a plant, so it would tell you what type of plant that the lamp most closely resembles. We then take our 500,000+ photos of plants taken every day and retrain the algorithm every month so that it gets smarter and smarter with every photo taken. PlantSnap also has a social network for plant lovers along with indicators for endangered species, plant care, gardening tips, toxicity, etc. Bottom line...PlantSnap is an app for plant lovers and nature enthusiasts around the world to congregate, share plant photos, discuss plants, and identify plants in 37 languages. Google Lens is built to tell you if something is a lamp a car, a dog, a person, etc. If Google ever decides to build a plant recognition app, they would surely crush our business, just as they would dominate ANY market they chose to enter. Our company is different because we focus on micro-niches, like plants, mushrooms, insects, etc. Hope this helps answer your question!"

Did someone accidentally place the decimal at the wrong place? That's unheard of for a company at this stage with this type of revenue to set such high stock price. This leaves investors no upside room if the company goes IPO. There're billion dollar companies don't even trade more than $35.00 per share. Even if the company revenue might grow 10x, there's no way the stock is going to get $350 per share by IPO time. Please consult an IPO financial expert on stock price, leave some room for investors to get tangible return, and don't drive unnecessary stock price and valuation inflation on crowdfunding sites.

Would you please elaborate a little more on the goal $ to sale off the company. At over $35 a share the latest potential $ amount has to be huge. Being a company unlike any other has its potential.,"Hello James! The SEC rules do not allow us to predict when we will sell the company or for how much we think we will sell it. This offering is registered with the governmental agency, the SEC, and we have to follow their rules about promising a certain return or a certain time frame.

All that we can tell you is that every person who works at PlantSnap shares the same goal of selling the company or taking it to the public stock market as soon as we possibly can. We all benefit at the same time you benefit, so we have the same goals as you…do earn a very nice return as soon as possible.

Also, the SEC requires us to post yearly updates of our financials and operations, and every investor receives that report.

Finally, the share price seems high, but that is because PlantSnap, Inc does not have many shares issued. When you look at investing at a company, look at the valuation price, not the share price. If you think the valuation we set for PlantSnap in this offering will increase if we continue to grow, then you should invest. If you do not think our valuation will increase if we continue to grow, then you should not invest.

Either way, we thank you very much for your time and consideration!

PlantSnap Incorporated,https://www.startengine.com/plantsnap-inc,Reid Ten Kley,,No,3 months ago,"Hi Eric, thank you for the reply. I'm a CPA and use to do SEC audits and offerings 'back in the day' so I hear you on how onerous the guidelines of the SEC can be. In this case you have some statistics for 2019 (number of installs), what else can you share- like #paid/unpaid installs, number of advertisers on the platform 2018 vs 2019 etc. Things that would be non-financial nor audited?","We had a second outside firm verify our app metrics, and that report is also included in our SEC Filing. App metrics are easy to verify because they are reported within 24 hours by Apple and Google, so we were able to include 2019 app metrics in this report. If it hasn't been audited or ""verified"" by a third-party firm, we are unable to provide that information, unfortunately. One thing in the metrics that is verified is that the PlantSnap 30-day retention rate averages 47% while the industry average is 13%, our CPI (cost per install) with FB ads averages 55 cents across all languages compared to $2.98/install industry average. Average monthly usage per user is 6 times/month for iOS users, 3.4 times for Android."

In your investment summary, you provide # of install data for 2019 but only revenue data for 2018. Do you have any quarterly revenue data you can share for any part of 2019? thank you. Reid","Hello Reid! These types of Reg CF crowdfunding campaigns are tightly regulated by the SEC and they have strict rules and guidelines about how the offerings must be presented. The guidelines mandate that we have a financial review and audit for full calendar years, which we have for 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are also required to post updated financials and corporate information with an SEC filing every year in April. At that point we will be adding our audited 2019 financial information. Because our 2019 financials haven't been finalized, much less verified or audited, we are not allowed to even discuss them. Nor are we allowed to present you with our projected sales or revenue. It's a good thing because it protects the investors, but it's also an inconvenience for the companies doing the offerings because we are limited in sharing information that would make this offering even more appealing.

Please explain why this is the case. Also, please let us know how Plantsnap plans to increase profitability.","Hello Raymond! Building PlantSnap was incredibly difficult, to say the least. If it was easy, it would have been done a long time ago. Simply building PlantSnap to work in English and only in the US took 5 years. Translating it into 37 languages, adding 550,000 more species and building 2 more versions of the app so that it could be used by any person in any location on Earth was an entirely different level of complexity -- incredibly difficult, time-consuming and expensive. Now it's complete, and other than updating the algorithm and making improvements to the user experience every month, the cost of maintaining PlantSnap is minimal. We made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot while building PlantSnap -- what to do and what not to do -- as is always the case when doing something that has never been done before. From those lessons and years of hard work, we now have a replicatable process in place that we are using to create many other ""EarthSnap"" apps that will eventually identify every living thing on Earth, much like having a Tricorder from Star Trek in your pocket. It's going to take time and money, but not nearly as much time and money as it took to build PlantSnap. Here is a list of everything that was done in 2018 -- the reason why our costs were higher than our revenue during the first full year that PlantSnap was live in the app stores.
• Built and launched 2 new PlantSnap apps (Android Freemium July 2018, iOS Freemium March 2019)
• Ended 2018 as top 5 paid app in entire App Store; promoted on Apple stage last 3 years
• 550,000 more plants added to the database, only had 55,000 plants in 2017
• Translated all 4 apps into 37 languages, as opposed to English-only in 2017
• Now used daily in over 200 countries as opposed to US-only in 2017
• 30 million installs, as opposed to 10,000 installs in 2017
• $6 million+ in revenue as opposed to zero dollars in revenue in 2017
• PlantSnap 3.0 launched with social media features similar to Instagram but focused on plant and gardening enthusiasts. Retention rate now in top 5% of all apps in existence
• Distribution deals with APGA and BGCI to distribute PlantSnap for free to 700 million people worldwide through their associations with over 1200 botanic gardens around the world
• Api licensing deal with top 5 tech companies launching end of 2019 (can’t mention this now due do strict NDAs)
• Organic growth of roughly 750,000 new installs per month
• MushroomSnap completed and waiting to be released, both iOS and Android
• PlantCatch 75% complete
• InsectSnap and other Snap-apps in production
If you are looking for a company that is a ""one-trick-pony"", PlantSnap, Inc. is not for you. If you are looking for a company that is going to change the world by putting a ""tricorder"" in hundreds of millions of pockets around the world that allows you to identify any living thing on Earth that you might encounter, you're in the right place!"

Unfortunately, with these types of investments, there are no dividends. However, as with all startups, our goal is to build PlantSnap as big as we possibly can and to sell it. If and when that happens, you benefit along with the founders and employees. There are 3 ways that you can/will earn a return on our investment:
1) PlantSnap sells, and your stock sells along with the founders and employees
2) PlantSnap goes public with an IPO and you sell your stock on the exchange

If you live in Sydney, Australia, you will be able to click the new ""Get button"" and see a thumbnail view of the plant for sale in several online stores that service the Sydney area. Clicking that link and buying the plant will give PlantSnap a commission on every sale. Google charges for a click to the store page, we are going to use a commission structure for that particular ad unit so that advertisers can continue using Google if they like and also add PlantSnap to their advertising initiative without adding incremental cost because they won't be paying us unless we make a sale for them. This is the only ""ad"" that will be in the paid versions of the app. We consider this a value-added service of the app and not an actual ""advertisement"""

For the paid users, yes, we have our ""Get"" button on every plant information screen. Clicking this button sends you to a store where you can purchase the plant. We are currently building a sales team to form partnerships with online plant distributors in every major market on earth so that the Get button will eventually be customized to whatever part of the planet where you live.

Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,John Scott,,No,a month ago,In my opinion it is deceiving for you to use Hemp as your source of CBD but show a early flowering Cannabis plant in this synopsis. This is like snake oil deceit in my opinion. There are already of companies doing this same scam in gas stations nationwide.,"Hi John, I am not really sure what you mean. That is exactly what our plants look like, I can send you a picture if you would like taken from my iPhone. I am not sure if you are referring to hemp used for fiber or not but the hemp we use flowers just the same as high THC concentration cannabis, if that is what you are referring to. We are actually even starting an indoor grow here in Oakland of high grade CBD, CBG flower with THC concentration below the .3% level. When we refer to hemp it is only a legal definition meaning it falls below the .3% THC level. Our grow partners are some of the best there are, winning multiple cannabis cups, and the plants will be grown using aeroponics in one of the most sophisticated grow rooms in the country. The first grow to completely integrate all control systems into a single software where every parameter can be controlled via an iPad. I have seen many impressive grows and these guys blew me away. The outdoor gowns hemp we uses is the same quality plant it is just not taken to the full potential you can get from a controlled indoor environment. I am aware there are many companies selling inferior product but I can assure you we don't fall in that category and selling our product in gas stations is not in our business model."

Thank you,

Jordan Talley","Hello Jordan, Sorry for the slow response the last week has been very hectic. We will be posting an update about product in the next day or so. Our tincture and gel caps have been packaged and are in route to our drop shipper. We are waiting for an exact date for the pet treats packaging, most likely next week. The delays have all been packaging related and not CBD product related. There were minor issues that needed to be resolved in order to complete the first packaging run. The good news is they have been resolved and we ordered extra packaging so we have enough packaging on hand to double inventory quickly. With the timing of the holidays the reality is it will be after the new year to launch and we will update everyone on the exact date but it is very close. Our finances are audited so we will be submitting everything after the new year to the accountants.. I will need to check with Start Engine to see how we update them for an ongoing campaign.

Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,Kenyetta Wells,4,Yes,2 months ago,"I'm new to understanding the difference between Spectrum and THC free CBD. My question is, as of late there have been 2-4 cases where individuals have received a positive drug test from using THC free CBD. I'm not saying your product is the CBD that was used, but you claim that you have a THC free product. If someone used your THC free CBD and received a positive drug test, would you stand behind your product in court if that person lost their career?","Hello Kenyetta,

Thanks for the great question and it is an important one. What Spero can guarantee is that our products are tested twice for presence of THC before it reaches a customer, once in-house and once by a 3rd party laboratory licensed by the State of Colorado. The lab analysis will also be available for the customer to verify. It would be impossible for Spero to guarantee anything beyond that due to many factors. A person could take a drug test that results in a false positive and there is always the possibility that a person consumes something else other than Spero CBD products either willingly or unwillingly. Unfortunately, there are many companies which make claims about their products without really knowing for sure. They may claim it to be THC free, or even believe it to be THC free, but without a lab analysis there isn’t any way to know for sure. Some companies even illegally sell “THC hot” products which means they have a THC concentration over the 0.3% legal limit. This can occur because the THC concentration of the extract after processing can go above the original hemp plant’s concentration of THC and unless you test after extraction you cannot know the exact THC concentration.. There are new regulations coming soon from the USDA regarding THC concentrations and testing of “industrial hemp”. One of the most controversial is the combination of THC-a and THC concentrations being used in the .3% limit and that tests must be completed by a DEA approved testing facility. The regulations are still in the commenting phase so we don’t know exactly what they will be yet, but we do know that new more restrictive THC testing regulations are coming. We pay close attention to the legislative process and on any new regulations. We work with Harris Bricken law firm, one of the premiere cannabis law firms in the country, to help ensure we are making decisions based on the most up to date laws and regulations. This is such an important issue because as you mentioned people’s careers can possibly be affected and we commit ourselves to testing of all products."

For some of the main points to your questions. All of our hemp is sourced from Colorado. Extraction is CO2 super critical for all products. We don't hype up the CO2 extraction like many companies do because we believe that all the available extraction methods have their pluses and minuses, and most of them are actually related to manufacturing and equipment operation more than it does to the quality of product. Luckily for us, CO2 seems to be the preferred method by consumers. THC is removed through liquid chromatography."
Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,MaryLynn Dodd,10,No,3 months ago,So as I was looking I found a couple prices you indicated on one of the comments. The prices are higher than I see on other sites also offering organic. What is the reasoning behind the higher prices? Thank you,"Hi MaryLynnn, Our pricing is very competitive with any product that is on par with the quality we offer. There are many products on the market that are considerably cheaper but they are not anywhere near the quality we offer. Many factors have to be evaluated when comparing products and being made from organically grown hemp is only one component. Unfortunately being made from organic hemp does not guarantee product safety either. We are currently speaking with an investigative journalist from a major news source and they are about to come out with a piece about the CBD industry and how the majority of products do not meet safety standards or match what is listed on their labels. In their investigation they purchased and sent several popular CBD brands, which were recommended to them as high quality products and listed as organic, to a quality lab testing facility and they found high levels of heavy metals and residual solvents. They are speaking to us and are interested in Spero because of our rigorous lab testing, which guarantees our product quality with total transparency. High quality CBD is still a fairly expensive product at the moment and we hope to bring prices down overtime to make quality CBD more accessible, however we will never cut corners on quality and safety and our current pricing is tied directly to the cost of producing a premium product. We know exactly how much it costs to produce quality CBD and we keep our margins tight, so if a product is being sold at a cheaper price there is somewhere in its production chain that is costing less to produce, but this comes at a cost on quality. We made a decision early on only to offer only top quality products and we believe this strategy is the correct one for the longterm approach we are taking."

Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,jennifer brena,,Yes,5 months ago,Is it true that some THC is needed to stay combined with the CBD in to metabolize in the system or is that a false hearsay?,"Hi Jennifer, Not sure what happened but I had responded to your question before and for some reason it didn't post. I only noticed this now when responding to another comment.

Your question is a good one and also one that has a lot of either confusion or misinformation about on the web. The short answer to your question is no, THC is not needed to metabolize CBD in your system. Sometimes I have also seen people claim that THC is needed to ""activate"" CBD, which is also not true. The only thing that ""activates"" CBD is the conversion of cannabidiolic acid CBDA (the natural form of CBD found in the plant, which is ""non-active"") to CBD. This is done through decarboxylation during the extraction process. THC also needs to go through this process by converting THCA to THC.

With that said, there is research that indicates that a combination of CBD and THC is more effective for some treatments rather than CBD on its own and this is where I believe the confusion over this stems from. However, there are a lot of details which are important to take in consideration when looking at this research including the needed THC concentration levels for this to occur and it is important to note that this research has only been done on those specific treatments. I believe CBD and THC can be a powerful combination for some people and some conditions and we recommend people to research into this option to see if it right for them.

When referring to the “Entourage Effect” there are many things people fail to mention when discussing this. The most important being is that we know very little about it or why it exists. Research points to the idea that when the numerous cannabinoids and terpenes found in the cannabis plant are used in conjunction they seem to be more effective than any individual one on its own. The theory is that they work in combination to have a “synergistic” effect. I believe this to be true and research seems to back this theory up, but it is still not clearly understood exactly why and much more research is needed. I believe a lot of the most interesting research we will see coming in the future will be in this area and learning how to “dial” in the cannabinoid and terpene levels to ones specific needs.

If you would like to learn more about the “Entourage Effect” I suggest researching about Dr. Ethan Russo. I consider him to be the one of, if not the, world’s leading researcher in this area. I suggest reading actual research papers and articles written by him as many blog writers have misinterpreted his research in various ways. I hope this helps answer your question a bit."
Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,Bill Monical,,Yes,5 months ago,When will investors be able to order with their discounts applied?,"Hello Bill, We are planning on beginning to accept and ship orders on Oct 21st. Investors will be able to immediately purchase product with their discounts. We want to prioritize serving our investors not only because they should be prioritized as key stakeholders, but also because we believe they will be some of our best ambassadors. We currently don’t see any reasons for us not to meet the Oct 21st target and things are moving along according to our timeline. Our first run of raw product has just finished and goes off to a third party lab for testing this week. This takes about 7-10 business day to receive all results. After we receive the results and assuming they match our internal tests we will begin the bottling and packaging process. We will advise our investors if something arrises we think would cause a delay to meeting our target date but at the moment we are looking good."
Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,Charles Givens,20,No,6 months ago,Will your product labels all have the USDA Organic Seal and all be certified Non-GMO Project Verified?,"Hi Charles, Thanks for these important questions. Although we work with only organically cultivated hemp, we currently cannot use the USDA organic seal because the certification process is still being completed. This process is in its final phase and we expect to be able to use the USDA seal in 2020 after final certification is received. Our products are Non-GMO, Halal, and Kosher certified. We believe using organic methods in hemp cultivation is critical to consumer safety as cannabis is a well-documented bio-accumulator and easily absorbs toxins and heavy metals from its environment. All Spero products are tested for pesticides and heavy metals to ensure a clean and safe product for our customers. We hope you add Spero CBD to that impressive portfolio of Start Engine investments you are building."

And will each batch be lab tested so consumers can check that their batch is completely pesticide/thc free? Thanks for your time!","Hi Francisco,

Happy to hear you are interested in Spero. Our products are produced from organically grown USA hemp. It does not have official organic certification so we can’t use the seal yet, but this certification process is in its final year and final organic certification is expected in 2020. Also, each batch of our products are lab tested. They are tested for major cannabinoid concentration levels (THC shows non-detectable levels), terpene analysis, residual solvent analysis, pesticide analysis, and heavy metals analysis. Not only will these results be readily available online for customers to access by inserting their individual product/batch lot code on our site, but we will be heavily promoting and encouraging our customers to do so. We will have educational content explaining how to read the reports and why they are important. Transparency and education are two pillars of Spero’s ethos. The nice thing about working with a clean and superior quality product is that you can use test results as a badge of honor versus brands which try to explain or evade questions about what is in their products. We hope you join our growing community of investors."
Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,Wesley Ray,,No,6 months ago,So there are no stocks to be gained from buying into this company?,"Hi Wesley,
Your investment would convert to stock shares. Your investment would be a convertible note which starts earning 8% interest on day 1. It then converts to stock at a 20% discount from the share price established at the next round of financing. I would recommend taking a look at this video here,
https://youtu.be/njx09wXb9o0

It does a pretty good job of explaining how convertible notes work and how your investment would automatically convert to shares in the company. If you have any specific questions after watching that video please feel free to ask."
Spero CBD,https://www.startengine.com/spero-cbd,Scott Tobia,4,No,6 months ago,"So what I see is a 6 million valuation, no sales, no inventory so where does the valuation come from","Hi Scott,
We couldn't agree with you more. How do you put a true valuation on a pre-revenue company? You really can't, which is one of the reasons we chose to offer a convertible note investment versus shares at a set price. The $6 million you are referring to is the valuation cap for the convertible notes and not a valuation of the company which has yet to be established. A convertible note allows time for the company to grow and establish a basis for which the market can then determine an actual valuation based on real data. We believe this is a better way to value startups and also helps ensure that early investors will receive a share price cheaper than the next investors by offering the 20% discount at conversion.

Our convertible note pays investors 8% interest from day 1 of their investment and then the value of the investment converts to shares at a trigger event with the plan being to occur at the next round of financing. At this point an actual valuation will be determined for the new capital to enter. The convertible note investors will then convert their investment value plus accrued interest to shares at a 20% discount from the investors at the trigger event. Let’s say at the trigger event a $1.00 share price (just for easy math here) is negotiated with that investor, then the convertible note holders will convert their investment amount plus accumulated interest to shares at a price of $0.80 per share.

The valuation cap is actually there to protect early investors from dilution in the case of a very high valuation at the next investment round, meaning that even if a higher valuation than $6 million is negotiated, the convertible note holders will still convert at the lower value of $6 million. If the reverse happens and a lower than $6 million valuation is negotiated than the convertible note holders simply convert at that same valuation as the new investor but at share price with a 20% discount.

We hope this addresses your question. Also, in regards to inventory, hopefully you see our recent update announcing that a production run is already underway and we expect to be selling product and starting to generate revenue in 60 days."

""While we do not market in UK or Canada, or solicit investments from UK or Canada, we are aware that regulators from certain UK countries or Canadian provinces have raised questions with respect to sales to UK or Canadian investors, and are taking the view that merely accepting money from UK or Canadian investors is a transaction that they have jurisdiction over, and that such offerings have to comply with the UK or Canadian equivalent of registration of the offering, or find an available exemption.

We have spoken with several wholesalers that have shown a high level of interest in working with us and our product. It could be possible for us to obtain some “vanity” PO’s but we decided not to go down that path. We say “vanity” because they would be non-committal as the wholesalers won’t commit until we have final product in hand with external packaging and we feel PO’s like this would be a bit misleading to announce since they would have no weight. It is worth noting that our co-founder Justin Jarin has a well-established network of distributors he has worked with over the last 15 years both on the buy side for his dispensary’s and on the sale side from his production partnerships. We plan on utilizing these distributors once we have product on hand to deliver.

Your product helped me recover after back surgery and regain my previous level of fitness. Using Elliptigo continues to allow me to change up workouts and cross train!

I have a question regarding the bank transfer when we commit to invest. Is the money transferred instantaneously from our account, or does this occur after the offer period closes?

If the money does transfer after the offer period closes, can we increase or decrease our investment commitment prior to that date?

Thanks,

Kevin

Thanks,

Kevin","Hi Kevin - Welcome to the investor team! I am thrilled that your ElliptiGO has helped you get back to your pre-surgery fitness level. Knowing that our products are making a difference in someone's life is a powerful force that keeps our team motivated here at ElliptiGO. I really appreciate you sharing it.

In my experience, the bank transfer takes place within a week of the commitment. That money goes to an escrow account where it sits until we request a disbursement or the round closes. If you want to increase your investment, you can always invest again, which is something that a number of people have done in the past. Obviously, we'll combine your investment amounts for purposes of your investor discount.

Does that answer your question?

Is there another way to do this? Also, can one do so and use PayPal or another form of transfer? Is that still requiring all of this info? The privacy policy basically and literally said do not have an expectation of privacy for your non-personal and personal info given here.

One more thing. Have you thought about giving larger discounts to a limited # of investors to get bikes out there? We could be some of the best salesman. I see there are for higher investors but to get these on the streets would pay back in large ways!

Randy","Hi Randy - Thanks for the question. My understanding is that the personal information is required to ensure we can identify you as the securities holder and can communicate with you in the future. If you want to invest more than $2000, then they are required to ask some additional information because there are rules around how much money you need to make in order to invest certain amounts in a crowdfunding campaign like this. If you keep your investment at $2000 or below, then there are no income qualifications required. I don't believe there is another way to invest that doesn't require the information they are asking for.

As you likely have noticed we do not discount our products very often. In fact, I believe the only time we reduced our prices last year was during our Black Friday sale. Our philosophy is to establish a price that is as fair as possible for us and our customers and then stick with it. We should sell our 30,000th bike this year, so we have quite a few on the road around the world now. We would love for every investor to buy a bike and we offer the investor discount as a way to say ""thank you"" for supporting us, but we don't think discounting is the way to build a great company. We also want people to buy our stock because they believe we can become a great company and increase the value of their investment, not because they want to save money on buying a bike.

Hopefully that make sense. Thanks again for the question. I'd love to welcome you to the investor team soon."

To anyone on this thread questioning a purchase of an ElliptiGo bike themselves, I can easily state that MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I DIDN’T PURCHASE ONE SOONER. I’m stingy with my budget. I tried other variations out there and was disappointed. I tried looking for test drive options. I wasted a whole year trying to qualify this expenditure. :(

I can attest that if one is a runner or a cyclist, you’ll easily give up both for the fun and results of the ElliptiGo.

I look forward to seeing this further success.

Thank you",That's great! Thank you for the note and for your enthusiasm!

ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Mary Mattingly,,No,5 days ago,"Hi Bryan,
My husband and I are looking at investing in your company but I have a few concerns. I am an avid cyclist (road, mountain and rail trail ) for many years. I bought one of the first mountain bikes in the mid80s and have watched that bike niche explode with City, State and National Parks making more and more room for these riders. I have also witnessed the explosion of rail trail all over the country with more and more cities and communities embracing that kind of riding. The commuter industry is also exploding with metro rental bikes on many corners in the urban cities. Now the electric or ebike is taking off across all of the different types of bikes--mtn, road and commuter. As a Fitness Professional, my interest in your stand-up bike grew out of the concern for too much sitting. I have been interested in buying one of the elliptigo bikes since I first received an email about them but there was no place in the southeast to demo them. Every time I brought up the desire to buy one, my husband was always suspect of the company and its viability and or growth given there was very little dealer participation across the country. Given the major switch from sitting to standing, it seems really important to get these physically exposed to potential customers. You say that marketing and product awareness seems to be a major issue and that you will use much of the funds raised on an infomercial with fitness celebs. Will you also seek dealers across the country to let consumers see, touch and ride your products?
Thanks,
Mary Mattingly","Hi Mary - Thank you very much for the question. We have done extensive surveying of both our customers and people who are interested in our products but have not purchased one yet. The results vividly demonstrate the importance of a test ride in the purchase process. That was one of the clearest takeaways from the surveys.

As a result, continuing to build out our network of places where people can easily try the product is an important part of our growth strategy. We see this as a critical part of the growth strategy and are working to address it. That said, however, we continue to believe that the biggest issues holding back our growth are deeper than access to test ride locations. We have more than 150 test ride locations around the country, but they aren't seeing the level of demand from potential customers that we need to be successful. No doubt if we had 1000 retail locations we would be selling more bikes. But, at the current level of demand we still wouldn't achieve our growth goals even with 1000 retail locations. The key thing we need to address are awareness and product legitimacy. Until we create enough demand for the product, just adding test ride locations isn't going to get us where we want to go. I agree we will better off with more test ride locations and we are working to grow that number, but we don't think that will get us all the way there.

Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?

Thanks again for considering joining our investor team, we very much appreciate it!

ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Randy Wilhelm,,No,5 days ago,"Bryan, quick question. With these bikes does one receive annual tune-ups or anything included in purchase? It is common in bikes of decent prices.

Also, marketing/awareness seems to be a major issue. I saw the elliptigo bikes in San Diego but have not been able to find around the St Louis area for test rides very easily and haven’t seen them around anywhere even though looks like a great product.

PT folks are pushing now that we sit too much and is bad for us, tighten and weaken glutes, hips etc. seems like something to capitalize on w stand up bikes.

Finally, how does one assure oneself that this whole funding request is not some scam.

Thanks,

Randy","Hi Randy - Thanks very much for the questions. I'll restate and answer each one individually so it's easy to follow:

*** With these bikes does one receive annual tune-ups or anything included in purchase? It is common in bikes of decent prices.

--- Like most bikes, the policies of the bike store where you purchase your ElliptiGO will govern how much free service and maintenance support you'll get. So, the results vary depending on the bike shop where you purchase, but my understanding is the same as yours - most of them provide free tune-up and maintenance for a period of time. Does that make sense?

*** Also, marketing/awareness seems to be a major issue. I saw the elliptigo bikes in San Diego but have not been able to find around the St Louis area for test rides very easily and haven’t seen them around anywhere even though looks like a great product.

--- We believe that marketing is our biggest issue, in two primary ways: Awareness and Legitimacy. To your point, we don't have enough exposure of the product, which means that most of the people who could really benefit from owning one don't even know it exists. Once they find out about the product, our second marketing issue kicks-in: Legitimacy. We have to overcome the cynicism about new fitness products because people fear/believe that they won't actually deliver the claimed product benefits and, since there is no ""social proof"" that riding an ElliptiGO is an acceptable/cool way to exercise, we have to make people feel comfortable being seen out and about on one. We are raising this money specifically to address these two issues because we believe they are the primary reasons why we have not grown the company as quickly as we expected to. Also, we have a great dealer in St. Louis - Pedego St. Louis. You can reach Bill the owner at bill@pedegostlouis.com to set up a test ride appointment.

*** PT folks are pushing now that we sit too much and is bad for us, tighten and weaken glutes, hips etc. seems like something to capitalize on w stand up bikes.

--- Yes! ""Sitting is the new smoking."" There is a lot of momentum around not sitting and we are part of the solution to that problem. If you are looking for exercise, there are so many advantages to stand up and elliptical cycling over traditional cycling, the challenge is communicating them all. More visible in traffic, time-efficient workout, whole-body workout, gentler knee angles are easier on the knees and hips, provides of a weight-bearing exercise, higher line-of-sight, more comfortable for your butt, back, shoulders and neck, better views, easier to ""bail"" in an emergency, much less likely to ""endo"" over the front handlebars, avoids the known issues with erectile dysfunction caused by the bike seat, doesn't aggravate an enlarged prostate. I could keep going. To your point, though, there's a lot of support in the physical therapy and rehabilitation industries for our approach to exercise.

*** Finally, how does one assure oneself that this whole funding request is not some scam.

--- That is a great question. You can contact ElliptiGO directly through our website (info@elliptigo.com) and ask. You can call us as well to check that we are really offering stock. The SEC regulates these kinds of offerings, so you can see our filing on the SEC website. That's probably the best way - just go to https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html and type in ""PT Motion Works"". PT Motion Works is our holding company that owns all of the stock in ElliptiGO. If you click on the top result ""Form C"" you'll see all of the details of this offering. You'll see that the link a few sections above here that says ""Form C"" takes you to the same place. That's probably the best way to convince yourself that this is not a scam.

Thanks Randy - Really appreciate you taking the time to ask these questions. Hopefully we will be welcoming you to the investor team soon!

Thank you for taking the time to ask this important question, I really appreciate it. This is a buy-and-hold strategy. All of the investors and employees are in the same situation. We do not expect anyone to sell their shares until we either get acquired by another company or successfully conduct an Initial Public Offering.

ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Rob Anderson,,No,12 days ago,"Hi Bryan,

As both a prospective customer and prospective investor, I have some concerns with the proposed use of the funds and some of the topics that haven't been addressed above that I'd like to get your further elaboration on.

*The vast majority of the funding is targeted for demand generation activities as you highlight that awareness is the highest priority issue facing the company. However, revenue was actually down YoY - what was the cause of the decline and what have you learned that will ensure that your next batch of demand generation activities actually grow revenue?
*Why is the company worth more if it is burning cash and sales aren't growing?
*What have you been spending on demand generation and what has the cost of customer acquisition been? How many more bikes do you expect to sell with ~$900,000 of incremental marketing spend?
*It appears that you've sold ~4,500 bikes/yr each of the last 2 years - at ~40% gross margins, how many bikes would you have to sell on an annual basis to be profitable? Cash flow positive?
*Should that demand generation activities be successful, do you have the capacity to build enough bikes to capitalize on it? Or will you need to come back to raise more funds to expand production?
*If you don't reach the $1M target, is the company viable? Without the extra marketing spend, how could you become a profitable operation?
*What efforts are being made to get costs down? Is there an expectation that the growth through the planned demand generation activities will be meaningful enough to enable favorable negotiations with suppliers to get costs down? At the relatively high ASPs for the bikes, ~40% margins seem light and it would seem imperative for costs to come down.

Appreciate your consideration of these questions that should give folks a better indication of the health of the company. I recently had an opportunity to demo several of the products and can attest to their quality - need to make sure it's a company and not just an interesting product, though, to determine the value of an investment.

Thanks!
Rob","Hi Rob - Thank you very much for asking such a thoughtful set of questions. I really appreciate it. If I don't give a complete answer to any of them below, please let me know and I'll do my best to clarify.

*The vast majority of the funding is targeted for demand generation activities as you highlight that awareness is the highest priority issue facing the company. However, revenue was actually down YoY - what was the cause of the decline and what have you learned that will ensure that your next batch of demand generation activities actually grow revenue?

--- From 2010 through 2016 we were entirely focused on scaling revenue. We staffed our company to be ready for explosive growth. As a result, we were consistently unprofitable, even as we grew revenues up to $5.8 million in 2016. In 2017, we recognized that this was an unsustainable trajectory because we had not found a scalable, ROI-positive marketing spend that we could invest in to reach profitability. As a result, we decided in 2017 to move our focus from growing revenues to controlling costs to reach profitability. We restructured the business as part of the hard work of dramatically reducing our expenses. That is why you see in 2018 we cut our net loss in half compared to 2017. We have continued to reduce our expenses since then and we believe we are in a position to be profitable in 2020 on as little as $4 million in revenue. We believe running the company profitably is achievable and sustainable without any proceeds from the fundraise.

The purpose of the fundraise is to give us the capital to target what we see as the two biggest barriers that we believe are holding us back from significant growth: awareness and legitimacy. We have just signed endorsement deals with two fitness celebrities who have been using our products for several years and who we believe can provide us with a real platform to address these issues. If we do that effectively, we believe it will put us back on a growth trajectory. We will be announcing these celebrities and their endorsement of our products soon.

*Why is the company worth more if it is burning cash and sales aren't growing?

--- Since 2017 we have:

- Signed the endorsement deals referred to above. As discussed, we believe promoting their authentic usage over the past several years and true belief in the benefits of our products will provide a significant boost to our efforts to not only raise awareness, but also to legitimize our products.

- Increased the total number of ElliptiGO bikes on the road by more than 40% from 19,000 to over 28,000

- Doubled the number of high school and university teams using our products to more than 300

- Launched three new bike products, including our first off-road model (the MSUB)

- Next month we expect to be shipping our first custom stationary trainer that works with all of our models.

- Completed the difficult work of cutting expenses to put ourselves in a position to be profitable in 2020, making us a much more viable business than we were in 2017.

For these reasons, we believe we now have a more valuable company than we did in 2017, the last time we had an equity offering. In addition, in 2017 when we did that fundraise, we raised more than $2.7 million total between our Regulation Crowdfunding and Regulation D offerings, and our Regulation Crowdfunding was oversubscribed by almost 30%. This time we are targeting $1.5 million total and our expectation is that it will once again be oversubscribed.

*What have you been spending on demand generation and what has the cost of customer acquisition been? How many more bikes do you expect to sell with ~$900,000 of incremental marketing spend?

--- Our spend on demand generation has varied over the years from lows of around $200,000 per year to a high of more than $1 million per year. Our CPA has varied over the years as well. The reality is that the majority of our customers right now are referred through word of mouth or seeing our product in use. It’s actually not our marketing spend that drives the majority of our sales right now. Our intent is to use this capital infusion to change that by investing in the promotion of our celebrity endorsers to not only reach new audiences that have never heard of an elliptical bike, but, more importantly, provide a convincing narrative about the value of this new category of device. We believe this will enable us to more directly inform our target consumers about why they would be better off owning an ElliptiGO.

Also, it’s important to note that our target for this fundraise is a total of $1.5 million. We expect to raise $1,070,000 through this Regulation Crowdfunding on StartEngine and then another $500,000 from accredited investors through our Regulation D offering. So we expect to have more than $900,000 to invest in our marketing efforts. Also, to be clear, the price of the stock is the same in both offerings.

*It appears that you've sold ~4,500 bikes/yr each of the last 2 years - at ~40% gross margins, how many bikes would you have to sell on an annual basis to be profitable? Cash flow positive?

--- As I mentioned above, we have done the hard work of cutting expenses down to the point where we believe we can be profitable and cash flow positive in 2020 on revenues of as low as $4 million.

*Should that demand generation activities be successful, do you have the capacity to build enough bikes to capitalize on it? Or will you need to come back to raise more funds to expand production?

--- We believe that the supply chain capacity is there to scale our business quickly. The bicycle industry produces tens of millions of bicycles every year. The supply chain is well established and the off-the-shelf components we use are made in quantities that are orders of magnitude more than what we require. The manufacturing technologies our manufacturers are well understood and scalable. If the demand is there, factory capacity should not be a barrier to us capturing it.

Our expectation is that this will be the last equity-based fundraise that we do before achieving an exit. We have very reasonable terms with our suppliers and our expectation is that we will be able to fund working capital needs as we grow through debt instead of equity. That said, we don’t know exactly how the future will play out, and there are foreseeable scenarios where we would do another equity fundraise, for example if we saw a lucrative but very expensive marketing opportunity that we wanted to capitalize on and could not fund in another way, but we believe this will be our last fundraise and we should not need to issue equity to expand production.

*If you don't reach the $1M target, is the company viable? Without the extra marketing spend, how could you become a profitable operation?

--- As discussed above, we believe we are situated to be profitable in 2020 and onwards without this fundraise. We intend to use this money to find a scalable, ROI-positive marketing spend that puts us back onto a growth trajectory.

*What efforts are being made to get costs down? Is there an expectation that the growth through the planned demand generation activities will be meaningful enough to enable favorable negotiations with suppliers to get costs down? At the relatively high ASPs for the bikes, ~40% margins seem light and it would seem imperative for costs to come down.

--- We believe that the primary driver of the high costs of our products is that we are single-sourced. Our experience is that we don’t have enough volume to create competitive pricing from our supply chain. We expect that growing our volume of purchases from our suppliers will create more interest from other suppliers in working with us, which should enable us to get much more competitive pricing from them. In addition, we are continuing to push new product development with cost reduction in mind.

I think you are asking how to navigate around obstacles at slow speed. Is that correct? if that's right then you basically do it like a bike. You can either stay on the pedals and balance and steer, or you can put one foot on the ground and ""scoot"" around something.

ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Ron Critchley,,Yes,20 days ago,"I have a couple of questions.

1. Is the 3.5% processing fee charged in addition to the purchase price or is it included?
2. It appears that you are offering both D2 and D3 shares. What's the difference and how would one specify a preference in the purchase process?

Thanks,
Ron Critchley","Hi Ron - Thanks for asking the questions.

1. Yes - the 3.5% processing fee is on top of the shares purchased. It's a true fee charged by the site for processing the investment. So, to buy $700 worth of shares (100 shares) you would be charged $724.

2. The Series D-2 and Series D-3 provide the same preference and payout and have the same price ($7.00). The Series D-2 shares require a minimum investment of $50,000 and the D-2 shareholders have the right to vote on issues brought before the shareholders. The Series D-3 shares have a minimum purchase of $700 and are non-voting shares.

When I was reading through this, I was thinking about how to reach a larger audience. When I read the comments about two celebrity endorsements and a long form video, that raised some questions for me. Who is the audience for a long form video? This could be my lack of knowledge of the fitness industry, but to me, everything is quick and viral these days?

What is the target audience(s) to increase the sales as needed for growth? I would think it would need to be as broad and common as possible. Seeing a person who’s dedicated their life to elite fitness tout a product that helped them maintain their elite athleticism isn’t exactly motivating.

Secondly, please tell me that one of the celebrities is a female. In this era, this can’t be a bro show. Additionally, the Elliptigo does help with some traditionally female problem areas.

From an investment standpoint that is good news, however, as a consumer and someone who loves my Ellipitigo bikes I have some concerns. Will the quality of the product remain high? Will warranties be honored? Will any of the current wonderful staff at Elliptigo be retained? You state that an additional 10% discount applies to early investors for 2 years, but how long will the other discounts be available if I chose to invest? thank you!","Hi Jim,

Thanks for the good questions. Our expectation is that if the industry takes off like we expect it will, then larger players will start making elliptical and stand-up bikes. We believe that they will pretty quickly realize the value of our intellectual property portfolio and decide that they would be better off owning it. As a result, our expectation is that we will get a great offer for the company and that selling it will be in everyone's best financial interest.

What happens next in terms of the product lines and staff would be up to the acquirer. That said, my expectation is that they would want to incentivize our employees to stay because, as you note, they are the reason that we've been successful to date and they will be the reason this industry scales. Also, I am confident that warranties would be honored and if the industry grows like we think it will, there will be high-quality products available. I wouldn't worry about that.

Also, selling the company isn't our only potential outcome. It is possible that we will instead choose to file an initial public offering and make our shares available to trade on the markets. That path would likely alleviate some of your concerns and is a very possible outcome as well.

The standard discounts will last as long as ElliptiGO is operating, regardless of who owns it. My hope is that's at least for my lifetime. I've already invested personally in this round, so even if the company eventually gets rid of me, I expect to be able to get my discount as long as there's a brand called ElliptiGO making bikes!

ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Daniel Rhon,,Yes,a month ago,"I just had a couple of questions, that might seem obvious to some but just want to make sure I'm clear:
1) Is the only way an investor gets their money back is IF there is an IPO? If the company is bought out, that's still not guaranteed a payout if it gets bought and doesn't go to IPO?
2) Is this an ""all or none"" venture, where you have to reach a threshold for those shares to be offered, and if you don't then it won't go through?
3) If ElliptiGo gets bought out are investors only getting back what they put in or also an appreciated valuation of the sale of the company (the value of the stocks at the time of sale). Some of the wording seemed to allude to only getting paid back what you put in.

Thank you for the clarification!","Hi Dan - Thanks for taking the time to ask these questions. Sorry they weren't laid out better above. Unfortunately, there's no way to format responses with paragraphs, so my apologies for how this reply will look. I've restated your question and then you'll see my answer starting with a ""---"" before it.

1) Is the only way an investor gets their money back is IF there is an IPO? If the company is bought out, that's still not guaranteed a payout if it gets bought and doesn't go to IPO?

--- No. If our company is acquired, all of the investors would get paid out. There would be no need to wait for an IPO of the stock. The biggest insurance blanket for the investors is that the common shareholders like me and all of our employees don’t get any payout from a sale of the company until all of the investors get paid back 100%. We issue “Preferred Stock” to investors, which gives them a “Preference” on any distribution. So, if we sell the company for $100 million and have raised $10 million total to get there, then the first $10 million goes to the investors exclusively, and then the remaining $90 million would get distributed evenly between investors and common shareholders based on ownership percentage.

2) Is this an ""all or none"" venture, where you have to reach a threshold for those shares to be offered, and if you don't then it won't go through?

--- Our belief is that we will hit the $1 million maximum like we did in 2017, but even if we fall short of that we will close on the amount we raised. So if you commit, then you should expect to become a shareholder on March 5 when we close the round.

3) If ElliptiGo gets bought out are investors only getting back what they put in or also an appreciated valuation of the sale of the company (the value of the stocks at the time of sale). Some of the wording seemed to allude to only getting paid back what you put in.

--- After the investors get paid back 100%, everyone gets paid out pro rata on the rest. So, in the example above, if you bought $10,000 worth of stock, then from the first $10 million that was distributed you’d get $10,000, then you would get your ownership share of the remaining $90 million, which would be about $30,000, for a total payback of about $40,000.

Does that all make sense? Does it answer your question?"
ElliptiGO,https://www.startengine.com/elliptigo-2,Kevin Jones,,No,a month ago,"I was wondering what the business plan looks like for the company. New products. What are the marketing strategies; television, social networking, etc. Also what is the current profit of the company. If still in debt when is profit expected. If the company is sold what happens with these shares.","Hi Kevin,

Thanks very much for your question. We will be launching a custom trainer soon that will give a much better indoor riding experience. I don't want to spoil the launch, but it will almost certainly be on sale in February. Obviously, products that are further out have more variability in the timing of when we will launch them, but I do feel comfortable mentioning that we have been working on an electric-assist concept for awhile now. We have some other things in the works after that, but I don't feel comfortable revealing them at this point in time.

We have made the adjustments to the company expenses that we believe are necessary so we can get profitable in 2020. That is our company goal - to be profitable this year. I believe it is achievable. Since we have such little debt, once we complete this funding round, if we can get to profitability I believe we will be in the best financial position we have ever been in.

We will soon be announcing a sponsorship agreement with two very big names in fitness. We will likely invest a significant portion of the money we raise through this process in leveraging their celebrity and networks to raise awareness about our products and also communicate that they are effective at delivering a great outdoor workout. There are many ways we'll leverage these individuals, but one of the most interesting to me is using long-form video to really tell the story behind our products and why they deliver such a great experience. These particular celebrities have been using our products since 2011 and are true believers. We'll be making this announcement about the sponsorship deal soon.

If the company is acquired, then all of the investors would receive a payout from the purchase proceeds. The most important feature of the type of stock we issue to investors (called Preferred Stock) is that it requires all of the investors to receive all of their money back before common shareholders like myself can receive any money for our shares if we are acquired. So, if you invest $10,000 and we have a total of $10 million invested in the company, then if we sell the company for $100 million, then you would get your $10,000 back from the first $10 million we distribute and then you would get your percentage from the remaining $90 million, which in this example would be about $30,000. So you'd get a total payout of around $40,000 in that scenario. This means we're really in the same boat in terms of looking for a great exit.

Does that make sense?

SONDORS Electric Car Company,https://www.startengine.com/sondors-electric-car-company,robert lane,,No,3 days ago,"Aloha,

So I have to say that when I received the email about the fishing rod and looked into it I was not at all thrilled with the offer. When offering a $10 fishing rod for $150 it made me question the whole Sondors product line.

I own a Sondors bike and I know the choice of buying from China was much better for the bikes than the fishing rods however it did nothing to reinforce the feeling of confidence in the quality products selection going into this vehicle. The choices going into the car will have their ultimate proving ground on the same roads as the brand name multi-billion dollar car companies. You can't choose an off-brand breaking system and not expect accidents.

I've been an early investor and want to cheer for the little guy trying to compete with the gigantic companies but not at the expense of safety and security.","Please hold your subjective judgment until you see this amazing piece of technology reviewed by actual XReel customers.

Yes, you are a wise investor and are walking into this with eyes wide open. I appreciate your comment as someone who gets that nothing in life or business ventures is guaranteed. As I mentioned over and over, regardless of what I touch, I do realize I am in an underdog position, so I will need to work smarter and make bold/innovative and unconventional steps in order to succeed. It sounds risky, but in reality, that is the only way to break this vicious cycle of combustion powered vehicle dominance. The good news is that most car makers are still asleep behind the wheel when it comes to affordable and mass embraced electric cars, and that means disruption is still in full play by someone like us."

However, you've raised over $1.5m over the span of 3 years from 2016 to 2018, unable to produce a prototype, then disappeared for over a year. Now you're back for another $1m raise - but it won't be enough to get your working prototype going until you have raised $15m in the near future?

Doesn't sound too promising to me. How can I be sure that you will be able to deliver a working prototype? never mind the ambition of actually starting producing.

Please help me understand the financial structure and the success strategy you have in place. Thanks.","You are misinformed. The video and images on this page are of the actual vehicle prototype we built.

This current raise is to build a pre-series vehicle, the bridge between our existing prototype and production.

The next step is to raise $15 million for tooling/production, engineering etc. Once the funds are raised, it will take approximately 15 months for SOP (start of production of Model SONDORS).

We are well underway with certification (homologation process) and have worked with a homologation expert in the past year to make all necessary adjustments to pass rigorous the homologation process. In order for us to complete the certification process, we are looking at 3-4 months.

We will continue raise funds as we see beneficial for our shareholders in order to increase the value of the overall company and have funds to execute next steps in the process to reach ultimate goal of production of the vehicle."

and how come such a lack of communication and updates...until now, when you need more money? i know a lot of people are really upset about the lack of updates and communication up til now.","Thanks for questions I'll do my best clarify. I strive to build forward-looking technology. That said, I will take you through the process. I was focused on keeping the entry price low and realized as we were working that most customers prefer range as well as a vehicle which performs great in winter conditions by switching from rear to front drive. I went back to drawing board to find the right powertrain solution in order to accommodate this aspect. The goal is to never ever put out a product which will not be commercially viable in the long term since that would not be beneficial to our shareholders, as well me personally as the largest investor and shareholder in the company. Increasing shareholder value is the most important task, and missing a few deadlines is part of the innovation and smart choices versus emotional/rushed decisions to advance a product which might not be best in the long term. We will get there even if it takes longer. Not interested in combustion propulsion, and frankly anyone who supported the Elio project was looking backwards and only have themselves to blame for shortsightedness of not seeing future moving away from ICE platforms. As far as communication, I do hear you, but I personally hate companies and their PR machines spinning out useless stories and updates to fill the gap or appease investor audiences when there is no valid information to be shared. That said, a ton was developed during this time, and frankly I had to focus on the task versus communication. There will be plenty of communication and information once we complete the current raise and move into execution stage. I have a proven record doing it and will continue on this path.

- To clearify your 15 month comment to SOP. Once the raise for current pre series vehcle is complete we will build it and then follow up with next 15mil raise at much higher valutiuon and share price. As soon as we start production raise we will provide detailed pre production and production schedule. We take it step by step not to get ahead of ourselves."

(I live in New England, how would the Vehicle live up in the harsh winters and weather ?)...
I am wondering if there has been any type of testing for the vehicle as it is front wheel drive and a three wheeled car...
How would that handle in the snow and ice, compared to a four wheel vehicle...
I understand the decrease in mileage, but I am wondering how it would handle in the ice and snow and if this vehicle is geared more toward the warmer climate areas....","Also, there is zero difference in handling between any front wheel powered combustion engine vehicle and ours. As far as four wheel configuration versus three wheel, you might find three wheel easier to handle in the snow. We are absolutely not geared toward warmer climates.

SONDORS Electric Car Company,https://www.startengine.com/sondors-electric-car-company,Rudy Banerjee,14,Yes,6 days ago,Can you please beak down your customer discovery process and summarize their responses? How do you differentiate yourself from Tesla? What is your competitive advantage? What is your strategy for the next 5 years?,"Really good question. Our primary goal is providing Tesla-level technology at more affordable prices for everyone. We do not see ourselves competing with Tesla, but rather having our own space for those who believe electric is the future. We will by all means avoid an expansive capital-intensive business model. We will use the Apple model for contract manufacturing as this model is the best fit in the current environment to produce high-quality product at a rapid pace. The entire Tesla model is built on a capital-intensive, everything in-house business model. We will avoid by all means poor vehicle design/engineering. Tesla continuously creates exciting concepts, like ""Falcon wing"" and many other examples, which eventually turn into ""production hell"" once rubber meets the road. We will avoid the hype features and use only production-ready components. This will reduce the trial and error stages significantly. We will implement an advanced air-cooled battery and motor (versus the Tesla complex to build a dated liquid cooled battery). As far as our customer discovery process, we believe anyone who drives a combustion engine vehicle today is our potential customer once meaningful and affordable alternative like SONDORS becomes available. We do not need to sell the product, it fills the need and it sells itself. Responses are positive. Keep in mind we are building a company in an open -- not in a closed --board room by choosing crowdfunding as a tool to raise funds, as you can imagine people who invest in us are also entitled to express their opinion, so we get a lot of input and support. This is way more efficient way to know and understand your market and customer as we keep things brutally transparent. Our five year strategy is get to production in the most efficient and shortest amount of time possible. After that, scale, scale, scale the company. The Model SONDORS vehicle is designed and engineered for mass production, so it is easy to scale. We certainly anticipate to have 500k vehicles on the road within 5 years of production, and hopefully many more."

What year can you realistically start selling the 1st 10 or 20 commercial cars, since your minimum funding goal is already met? 2. For the sharing model, what kind of insurance people will have to pay? 3. Is you EV compatible with the connectors of existing charging networks or you need to build new charging stations? 4. There're plenty of billion dollar companies don't trade above $30 after going IPO. You can increase your valuation, but did you really have to set the share price so high? 5. What is your exit strategy? Thanks.","1. Awesome question. The current raise is to complete a pre-series vehicle. The next step is to raise $15 million (for tooling/production, engineering, etc.). Once the funds are raised from that $15 million round, it will take approximately 15 months for SOP (start of production of Model SONDORS).

2. The insurance will be the same as you currently use for your car. You will not require any additional or special insurance. There are insurance providers which will give you discount for driving zero emissions vehicle, so do shop around for the best rate.

3. Good question. The answer is yes, you will be able to charge Model SONDORS at the public charging stations since we will use SAE J1772 EV plug. All electric cars in Canada and in the US can charge using this plug. 4. Great question. In simple terms, the stock price of a company is calculated by multiplying its share price by the number of shares outstanding. That said, some companies have millions of shares at low prices while others, like SONDORS Electric Car Company, have much fewer shares outstanding at a higher price. As far as your billion dollar comment, I would highly recommend you to see if they are actually making money or even breaking even. Many of these so called billion dollar REVENUE companies, like WeWork for example, were just going to use public markets to have cash grab from unsuspecting investors so they can continue to bleed cash and lose money but keep their doors open to run their day to day operations.


5. Great question. Personally, I want to see the company succeed and evolve into a major electric mobility player. Of course, as I am taking investor funds, I have to be fully aware and considerate of any exit opportunities beneficial to our investor community. A potential exit strategy includes strategic acquisition by someone like Uber or Amazon. Also, as much I would prefer to stay a private company for as long as possible, I do realize investors always prefer liquidity. That said, an IPO is on the table as well to be considered."

Initially, as your question indicates, in order to launch the SONDORS Network, we will need areas in which we can easily saturate with our vehicles. We expect Southern California, as well as the city of San Jose (with whom we have had very positive talks) and the Denver area, to be ground zero for the SONDORS Network launch, as these are areas in which we can saturate with our vehicles the quickest. That said, the SONDORS Network will be launched throughout the United States, and the SONDORS Network App will be available immediately once released — regardless of where one in the country lives geographically.

I also made a reservation to purchase a Sondor. Now, I see that the more shares are being floated at the price of $28.68 per share. Does that mean that the shares that I purchased three years ago are now worth $28.68 per share? Since I have previously purchased my shares at $12 per share and now there are more shares, thereby diluting the percentage of ownership, what incentive do I have to reinvest at a higher price for a smaller portion of the company?","As with any company, we are raising funds through multiple rounds as opposed to all in one raise.

The purpose for this is as follows: investors with a higher risk/reward tolerance are given the opportunity to invest very early-stage, which represents a high-risk yet potentially incredible return on your investment.

Based on your comment, you invested in our first round at $12 dollars per share. Once we completed said round, we went on to build our first Model SONDORS and, along the way, created new technologies which significantly increased the company’s value.

We also unveiled the vehicle in the LA Auto Show, proving the demand for the Model SONDORS via opening reservations. Investors coming into the next round are going to pay more per share as the risk of this project has significantly decreased thanks to early investors such as yourself.

This is still a very early round, so it is still an amazing opportunity to get in on the ground floor if one believes in the future of electric transportation, especially the one SONDORS is creating with an emphasis on mass electric transportation due to the affordability aspect.

There is no dilution of your shares, you are simply experiencing appreciation of the first investment round at $12, which have gone up in value to $28.68, and that is exactly what I plan on continuing to do (increase shareholder value as we execute this current stage of the raise).

Keep in mind that at $28.68, I believe this is still an absolute steal, and we expect the share price next round will be significantly higher than the current stage."

Also, what gross profit margin do you expect on a $20,000 vehicle sell?","These are good questions. The gross margin is expected to be 25% - 30%.

The biggest risk is failure to raise additional funds for the production phase, like tooling costs and additional operating as well as engineering costs.

That said, we are working to address this additional funding needed through a future Reg A+ raise (at higher valuations once the current phase task is complete or institution capital). We expect we will need additional $15 million in funding for the production phase."

Question regarding the competitive intelligence that Commerce.AI provides as you continue to scale. I know Coca Cola is a customer. What happens if you also sign Pepsi? You would have the two largest companies/competitors in the beverage industry using the same set of market data. Wouldn't you assume they would come to the same conclusion and launch the same products? How would Commerce.AI still provide valuable insight that's specific to Coca Cola or Pepsi?","Hi Jeff

Thanks for this great question. We are a AI platform provider. Brands use our platform to feed in data to come up with intelligence. This is probably a terrible analogy, but think about us as arms provider. That means it’s up to Coca-Cola or Pepsi to use our platform in more than one ways to come up with more than one type of intelligence. The more they use our platform with larger and larger data, the sharper they can get with the intelligence.

"Thalia Brands, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/thalia,Bruce Wertz,12,No,3 months ago,"Chris: Please help me to better understand the information we're being provided before I invest. First, as I understand it the shares being offered a for Thalia Brands, Inc. are for a new company just formed in 2019, and not for Thalia Cappos, LLC company. However, I don't see any information relating to whether or not the patents held by and the outstanding loans owed by Thalia Cappos, LLC have or will become the assets and liabilities, respectively, of Thalia Brands, Inc. Please clarify these points.
Second, do you have any interest in growing via the 3,700 retail stores in the US that grossed $4.5 Billion of revenues? I would think with a payment program of half due at time of order, the other half due within 10 days of deliver and no-return policy (for unsold inventory), it might be a viable growth area. Third, women accounted for almost 50% of the guitar sales in 2018. What plans does the company have to adapt its products to this segment of the market?

Bruce","Hi Bruce, Thanks for your note! In order to sell stock via this offering we had to convert our LLC into a C Corporation back in July. So Thalia Capos LLC converted into Thalia Brands, Inc. though a Delaware LLC to C-Corp conversion process and the new entity (Thalia Brands, Inc.) owns all of the assets and liabilities. Yes, we do have an strong interest in growing through retail stores! We have about 60 dealers right now and several large distributors. Wholesale has always been a significant piece of our business and we plan to make a big splash an NAMM in January with a push to get more dealers carrying our products, especially our co-branded products where we feel that there is a massive opportunity. As far as women are concerned, we have always over indexed with female guitar players compared to other brands. We have several products and designs that were made specifically to appeal to female guitar players. We do have some exciting products ideas planned for the future that are female focused that we will share that soon! Thank you!! Chris"

Another important note, because of the work that we do, we have been able to attract some amazing employees most of whom are professional guitar players and teachers. We provide a great day job in a field that is close to their passion and working with other fellow guitar players makes this an exciting place to work.

Here are some of the possible exit opportunities: 1) The company is acquired by another company at a price greater than the price per share you paid and your shares are purchased by the acquiring company. 2) You sell the stock to another investor for a price greater than you paid per share. This could be done in a private transaction or via a secondary trading exchange for startengine shares. StartEngine is currently building their secondary market / trading exchange which is expected to be launched sometime in the next 6-12 months subject to SEC approvals. 3) Thalia goes public and you sell your shares to another investor at a price greater than what you paid per share in the open market.

Thanks for the question. At this point, we do not intend to pay a dividend. We expect to reinvest all profits in the development of new products for the foreseeable future and build cash reserves where possible so that we can weather business uncertainties. If at some point in the future we were sitting on a ton of cash and it made sense to do a dividend we would certainly consider it but that is likely a long way off.

Regulation Crowdfunding has a 1 year lock before you can freely sell your shares. However, you can transfer or sell shares within the first year to family members and a few other entities. Here is what StartEngine has to say about it:

Investors are generally restricted from reselling shares for a one-year period after they were issued, unless the shares are transferred:

to the company that issued the securities;

"Thalia Brands, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/thalia,William Schmidt,8,Yes,5 months ago,"These are absolutely gorgeous pieces. I love the color and design work. With that being said, a built to order supply chain, tells me that it is not for everyone. Meaning that John, who just grabbed a guitar and started playing, is probably not going to invest in the product. These seem like more specialized products that are going to serious guitar players. What is your thought on that? And if your consumer base is more specialized with higher end guitar players, what is your plan to capture more consumers, making the customer base 1 million, instead of 100K loyal customers? How much of the 1 billion dollar market do you capture now and what is your plan to increase that market capture. Also what is your margin on your most popular products. Thank you for any answers. Again, gorgeous pieces.","Hi William,

Thanks for your questions!

Your first question is very interesting. While we do have a build-to-order supply chain so that we can offer a lot of variety, we do have a number of products that we build to stock so that we can serve the needs of people who want it immediately and achieve higher economies of scale. The BTO part allows us to keep low inventory levels and also reap higher margins for specialty items and custom shop when someone wants that. We are also capitalizing on the fact, that for the most part you cannot customize a guitar unless you are paying big dollars, say $4K and up. So that lower end part of the market wants customized inlays but are not being served; for many of them one of our capos is a great way to do just that. We do in fact have lots of customers who wind up getting one of our capos for their $300 guitar. This is because we are a very giftable item and something that is an attainable luxury. Now we certainly do also cater to the other end of spectrum too. Because our capos have interchangeable fretpads and different inlays, most of our customers like to ""setup"" a specific capo for each guitar that they own instead of swapping out fretpads for each guitar. We have hundreds of customers who own a dozen or more of our capos.

The addressable market of guitar players is estimated at 50 million. So, we have only scratched the surface with potential customers. We are also developing a range of new products that are attractive to different guitar players for different reasons. We went into picks so that we could offer a lower selling price so that new customers could gain experience with our brand. And indeed, we have had a large volume of customers who started with picks and then went on to try a capo and vica versa. So, our plan is to offer the best and most appealing accessories and use the breadth and variety to bring more and more customers into the brand.

We are currently capturing less than 1% of the addressable market. While we do have plans to offer some lower-priced products in the future, for now we believe that we have plenty of upside staying premium and building a quality brand that people trust. Selling online is very expensive to bring in new customers and you really need the higher price points and big margins to make it work. We spend about 25 cents of every revenue dollar on marketing now. Our gross margins on the vast majority of our products are >75%.

Thank you!

My question is about your financials. I noticed Revenue is down ~27 % from 2017 to 2018. Of course, two data points are insufficient to make a downtrend, but it's all I've got. So can you shed some light on what factors you believe affected your revenue? And are you able to share what you have done for revenue so far in 2019, and your marketing spend to get there? (I noticed you have about $4 in revenue for each $1 spent on marketing, so I'm trying to see if that still holds true)","Hi Ruben,

Thank you for the compliments! Here are some answers to your questions:

Decline in Revenue between 2017 & 2018
==================================
In December of 2017, we lost a key factory that made all of the metal components for our capos. Essentially, we had demanded high quality and we were a smaller customer and so they dropped us. This happened in December which is our busiest month of the year. We had plenty of inventory to complete the Christmas season but by mid-January we were running very low on A-Stock inventory. We did have sufficient stores of B-Stock so we switched to selling B-Stock which we sell at a 30% discount while we brought up the new factory and did some retooling.

It took us about 6 months to bring up a new supply chain and factory. The new factory became fully operational in June of 2018 and is superior in every way to the old factory. Quality has never been better. However, we were forced to sell mostly B-Stock during the first half of 2018 which we sell at a 30% discount. We were not able to make up for the loss in revenue caused by the factory change during 2018 and even though we had a very strong second half we came in under 2017.

We did take the opportunity while we were retooling the supply chain to redesign a number of products and processes so that we could run a leaner operation. Today our throughput is about twice what it was in 2017 and we have also taken a lot of cost out of the system by redesigning packaging and other components.

We also realized that while our capos are our key source of revenue, that we needed new products to get us back into hyper growth mode. So one of the reasons that we are diversifying now with more products is to reduce risk.

2019 Revenue
============
So far in 2019 we have done approximately $1M with a net profit of approximately $50K. Most of our revenue is weighted in the 2nd Half of the year and so we are feeling good about where we will end the year with our new product launches.

Marketing Performance
===================
For the first half of 2019 we spent ~26% of every revenue dollar on marketing, which is slightly better than in the first half of 2018. We do expect to spend around 23% for the full year of 2019. We do expect to have an uptick in marketing performance in 2019 because we will be launching a range of new products and we always get better performance in the first 6-9 months of a new product introduction."

The patent is huge, but since I'm not a scientist can you explain how many alternative antimicrobials there are that others could use, and have you patented the ""best"" combinations? 3. Can you update cash on hand and monthly burn, and what your runway would be if you raise 400K and pursue your expected timeline? Thanks!","Hi Alan,
Thank you again for your interest. Per your questions: 1. The USAF is awaiting approval from the IACUC to commence the animal testing. This approval process has taken longer than originally anticipated. 2. We feel that we have patented the best combinations based upon Dr. Sabacinski's extensive experience in wound healing. 3.

SanMelix Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/sanmelix,Alan Jacobson,30,No,7 months ago,"Hi, thanks for the thoughtful answers. To follow-up, does your potential patent mean that no one can combine Buckwheat Honey with any antimicrobial, or is it just Buckwheat Honey with a specific antimicrobial? If the latter, is it possible that other ingredients could do the same thing? Also, does FDA approval make it likely that insurance companies will cover your products, and conversely would FDA rejection mean they would not? And finally an easy one perhaps: There is mention of Dr. Sabacinski having patented 3 medical devices. Are these devices part of this offer? Thanks again!","Hi Alan. The three patents’ formulations contain three different antimicrobials, which Dr. Sabacinski feels would be the safest and most effective. We feel that it would be difficult for another company to overcome obviousness with a new patent that combined buckwheat honey and a new antimicrobial. However, we cannot be certain as to the final USPTO determination. The FDA determination does not determine if the dressings will be reimbursable under CMS; however, we must receive 510(k) clearance prior to determination of reimbursement. We are uncertain as to the outcome of reimbursement at this time. All three of the patents have been assigned to SanMelix and are included in this offer."
SanMelix Laboratories,https://www.startengine.com/sanmelix,Alan Jacobson,30,No,8 months ago,"Hi, this is quite intriguing but I have a few questions. First, can you say more about what exactly the patent you've filed would cover, and how easy would it be for another company to work around it and still use buckwheat honey? Second, If studies have shown that buckwheat honey is a better ingredient why has no one used it before, or if they have how successful were they and why will your product be better? Finally, how is the honey sourced and what does that sourcing mean for the health of the bee populations involved? (I'm also very interested in your answer to Barnaby, especially about runway.) Thanks!","Good morning Alan. Thank you for your inquiry. In response to your question:
The patents filed include various buckwheat honey formulations which are fortified with antimicrobials. Please refer to the following link for the studies:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5356818_An_in_vitro_examination_of_the_antioxidant_and_anti-inflammatory_properties_of_buckwheat_honey
The formulations are unique because of the combination of ingredients. Another company can use buckwheat honey alone, but it will not contain a standardized antimicrobial component. The buckwheat honey patent pending formulations are why we feel our product is better.
We have a supply agreement with a buckwheat honey supplier that must meet our quality control standards. In addition, we plan to test each batch of the buckwheat honey to make sure it is pure and unadulterated to ensure bees are healthy and have enough honey to feed themselves."

We have had a pre-submission meeting with the FDA in May 2018. We anticipate another $25,000 to complete the FDA 510(k) application after the AF testing. The $25,000 is included in our use of proceeds.

We had a $5 million valuation for the initial common stock offering. The Company has not undertaken any formal efforts to obtain a valuation of the Company. The price of the Units merely reflects the opinion of the Company as to what would be the fair market value of the Units. The Company based this on the U.S. Air Force's interest in the testing of the advanced wound care dressing, the addressable market sizes for the skin care products, the value of the patent pending applications, and the strength of the team and its advisors."

Smart soda offers both CBD free and CBD beverages.

According to Quest Diagnostics Director of Science and Technology, Barry Sample, CBD likely won't show up on a drug test: ""If the product contains only CBD and has had the THC removed, then an individual being tested would not be expected to test positive for marijuana or marijuana metabolite."" In other words, marijuana drug tests screen for THC, not CBD. This is an important point, because CBD is still widely taboo, as people assume it's the same as marijuana. However, because it doesn't bring that kind of high, people who use it aren't actually impaired. Thus, the risks that drug use brings simply aren't there."

Thank you for bringing this idea out. Have you considered lowering your gross margin? A lower margin would make the domes more affordable to a wider number of people, and quiet those nay-sayers about price per sq ft. Companies can thrive with much lower margins. Just a thought. And a question... how do you envision the loft floor to be constructed - of the same ceramic panels as the dome? or made of something else?
Good luck!","Hi Bruce! Thanks much for your investment!

The prices will come down over time.

We've found a lot of people would be willing to pay 2x the listed prices, as the bioceramic dome checks all the boxes for a premium luxury home. Rather than the domes being branded as ""affordable housing"", we're setting a mid range price for now, and are working on a program with Zappos based upon donating a dome to a transitional geodesic village for every 1-2 that are sold.

That said ..... in 5-7 years after we have really scaled production, and have any hope of meeting a mainstream demand, we will lower the prices. If we lowered the prices now, we could not meet the demand, and it would create pressure to reduce costs, rather than maximize quality, and the later is a better way to build a culture and a new technology.

There will be multiple options for loft floors. Some combination of ceramic and decorative wood. The ceramic forms molecular bonds with wood, and preserves it.

All the best,

Morgan"
Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Martin Griessmueller,,No,7 days ago,"Hi Everyone,
I am following the project for a while and truly agree with your vision. I'm a contractor myself and wish we had more innovations like yours.

I'm thinking of investing some money, but I got three question, how will you keep the domes sealed, special between the connecting parts? Second how will electrical outlets, wires and lights be installed? Third, can you nail or screw into the Bioceramic to hand Pictures etc?

Best Martin","Hi Martin!

Answers here:

How will you keep the domes sealed, special between the connecting parts?

Bioceramic is an inorganic polymer, so it forms a waterproof cold joint. The sheer bond strength is very high, and the thermal expansion is extremely low. So the whole dome is essentially glued together, with special joints that make the bonds so strong that it functions like a monolithic dome.

How will electrical outlets, wires and lights be installed?

Boxes for outlets and switches are precast into the panels. The wire is run through chases in the panels and composite frame as the dome is being assembled.

Can you nail or screw into the Bioceramic to hand Pictures etc?

Yes, the interior walls are cellular ceramic composites. You can screw into them and even cut into them with a saw. And you can mix the ceramic material on site to make repairs.

Much gratitude for being on this journey with us!

Best,

Morgan"

I wish I didn't have to step all the way from $999 to $9,999 to get a larger discount. Just one follow-up question: If you only raise something like 800K between this raise and the other investors, would you be able to use the debt financing for another 600K to get you to that 1.4M which seems to be the ideal amount for the next few steps?

In the end we will make sure this was fair for everyone. If you invest between $999 and $9,999 we will do a discount equal to 50% of the investment. With a total discount of not more than $5,000.

Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Martin T,,No,11 days ago,"Currently, the average cost of new single-family home construction is $100-$160 per square foot. That is less than the stated cost per sqft of a Geoship. Even if the life cycle cost is lower, as you propose, the upfront investment will be a big hurdle. How will that help if “average Americans can no longer afford a home in 74% of the housing markets?”
The costs of land and the development for residential use are significant cost-factors when purchasing residential real estate. Wouldn’t the footprint of a circular Geoship with loft actually be larger than for a two-story rectangular building, assuming the same total square footage of the useable living space?

Current building codes in California require that every newly-built home must now come with enough solar panels to satisfy its electricity needs. How do those fit on a Geoship, and how does it affect its structural integrity as well as other features? Solar panels are usually rectangular, while the individual elements of a Geoship are triangular.

How readily are Geoship structures financeable, i.e. are there lenders that will consider a Geoship as collateral on a secured loan (mortgage)? Or is your target market cash-buyers only?

Polyhedral structures are nothing new, they were introduced to the US in 1950’s. If they have the broad appeal, aesthetically as well as functionally, as you seem to assume in your market analysis, why aren’t they much more common already?

Conventionally built homes have some permeability to moisture released from cooking, showering, breathing, etc. How is the necessary air exchange accomplished in a ceramic shell like the Geoship? Mold can happen anywhere where there is the right combination of temperature, moisture, and organic matter. It isn’t necessarily limited to the building shell.

What is the world-wide supply of the input materials to produce Chemically Bonded Phosphate Ceramics? Where and how is it sourced? Is it sustainable at the scale you are proposing?

How much does the production timeline depend on the grant proposal you submitted to Clark County, NV, for multi-year grant funding? What happens when it is not awarded to Geoship?

Much of the homelessness exists in and around cities, since that is where most of the services are that people need. At the same time, land prices there are at a premium. To alleviate homelessness, couldn’t more people be housed in multi-story buildings, rather than sprawling geodesic dome villages?","PS - The geodesic dome is our flagship market entry product. We plan to expand beyond domes into other efficient geometric forms - even skewed boxes with domes up top ;-) We're confident in the geodesic market, but plan to test market other geometries.

The product is still in development, so we don't have detailed energy and structural specs yet. These numbers will be released in 3-4 months.

But the geodesic dome is the ""lightest, strongest, most efficient means of enclosing space known to man."" Bioceramic domes are monolithic — all the seams are bonded together — making them extremely strong.

Our design spec will be something closer to 270 mph winds and 270 lbs of snow.

The insulation value will also be very high, because the cellular ceramic has an R-value of 5-7 per inch, reflects >80% of radiant heat, forms a very tight envelope, minimizes thermal bridging, and the dome has about 50% less surface area than a typical box house with equal floor space.

From a financial perspective, what is the minimum you need to raise here to retain your full team and truly pursue your timeline above, and, similarly, what is your runway for each 250K raised here (again, assuming the above timeline and the full talent of your team)? 2. Have you considered a more graduated ""discount for investors"" policy - $999 gets me a $499 discount, but so does $9900. (I wish the discount was a % I guess, because I'd be quite interested). 3. What will give you an advantage over a large deep-pocketed company who rolls out a similar product (especially if you do not aggressively pursue patent protection)? Thanks!","Hey Alan!

Thanks for your questions.

1. In addition to the $1.06M we are raising here, we’re raising an additional $432K through strategic investors (at the same terms). We’re also raising up to $3M in debt-based financing.

The first $250k will be enough to finish our next dome prototype. $500k will get us into pilot production with a 90% confidence interval. $1M gets us into pilot production with 95% confidence interval, and allows us to spend $400K or so on virtual product development, to build our sales pipeline and establish Geoship as a thought leader in bioceramic architecture and materials. $1.4M gets us 98% into pilot production, and even further with virtual product development/sales pipeline. The additional $3M in debt financing (and potential grants) would be used to purchase land and construct a production plant, while ensuring we reach low volume production.

The moment we are in pilot production, we will open reservations and do another fundraise of at least $5M to build a full size production plant.

2. If you invest $9,999 you get a $4,999.50 dome discount. (maybe you missed this?)

3. Our advantage comes from a) our cooperative model b) our first mover advantage c) the sheer size of our market and d) IP and product design.

a) If all else is equal, we’ve found that home buyers show a strong preference for companies that are socially responsible, ESPECIALLY when the company can integrate that social responsibility right in to the DNA, through multi-stakeholder ownership. We need to ""unfuck"" capitalism, and multi-stakeholder cooperative ownership is very likely the way.

b) We are clearly the missionary first mover. Historically the second mover is more “mercenary” than “missionary” and the missionary companies generally win (there are many examples of this).

c) The market is absolutely gigantic. Even if Geoship became a $1 TRILLION company, there is room for at least TEN trillion dollar companies in the world of affordable regenerative resilient homebuilding.

d) We will be aggressively filling patents. And if there is a deep pocket mercenary company that tries to copy us, we will aggressively defend the patents.

Please see comments below for detailed answer here.

The only zoning restrictions we are aware of are infilling of existing neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods have convenants that restrict the look of homes. Thus our primary focus is in rural areas and whole new sub-urban communities, which is actually the bulk of the US market. Infill is a small percentage.

We look at this like an electric car. Domes look funny now, but in 10-20 years they will be normalized, and we believe eventually they will become more common on Earth than wood boxes.

I know CalEarth, as one example, has been spending considerable amounts of money to have their super adobe earth bag design allowed in any county in CA, and it has not been an easy process. Will acceptance with the Int'l Residential Design Codes you refer to below surpass any local building dept concerns regarding design and materials they are unfamiliar with? This has been a major hurdle for many who would like to use and demonstrate alternative materials and designs, and anything your company can do to help educate those in charge/decision-making positions and enforcement will really help. I own land in one of the most economically depressed counties in CA, as well as one at risk for fires, high winds, large temp swings high and low, and extreme differing micro climates within minutes of each other.

Thank you, this is all very inspiring and exciting, Amy","Hi Amy,

Apologies for delayed response here!

This is one of the beautiful aspects of bioceramic dome technology. It meets the international building codes, which have been adopted by all 50 states. Unlike CalEarth, we don’t have to spend money to change the codes.

All local building departments know what a geodesic dome is. And they all know what structural insulation panels are. And 99% have now adopted the international codes, so they allow for “alternative concrete” as long as it meets the strength and safety requirements, which our ceramic concrete far exceeds.

We’ve found thus far, that building departments welcome this technology. BECAUSE it is a standard mass production technology, which is much different than people pounding dirt into tires (Earthship), or filling bags with dirt and lashing them together with barbed wire (CalEarth). Bioceramic domes are a product, and each one has the exact same level of structural integrity, regardless of the installer’s skill level. The pieces only fit together one way, and each piece is produced in a controlled manufacturing environment with strict quality control. Bioceramic domes make the building inspector’s job easier.

We think that bioceramic domes will become the go-to form of single family housing in California, especially near small towns and in rural areas. And we look forward to working with you to educate the industry!

Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Laurel Evans,,Yes,a month ago,"How do the prices of the domes compare to the prices of similarly-sized conventional homes built in the same area? How much would the consumer likely save by buying a dome initially, and over the long run (due to lower maintenance costs)?

How difficult would it be to buy conventional furniture to fit into a dome? Would consumers have to rely on specialty furniture or custom carpentry?

How would very large families manage with larger domes? Could many be linked to create larger sqft homes?

What is the possibility of creating hybrid structures, for example a dome with a rectangular viewing window (for stunning views), or multi-story domes?

Kind regards,

For cabinets and countertops there will be a few standard sizes, but infinite variation in the colors, textures, aggregates, and woods that are used. The ceramic and wood compliment one another well, as the ceramic forms molecular bonds with wood. We envision a ""cottage industry"" of artisans who are building cabinets, countertops, loft packages, and even furniture for the geodesic homes, which also get packed into the shipping container and installed with the dome."
Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Helen Ruan,,Yes,a month ago,"Thank you Morgan. It'd be great if you can show some images of nails / screws placed on this type of interior walls. It's a bit hard to imagine the feasibility of nailing something hard into ceramic walls :) In terms of commercialization, what type of people and which regions are you targeting first? What's the projected number of domes to be sold over next few years? When do you expect to reach profitability? Thanks!","Hey Helen!

So sorry to miss this second comment!

SCREWING/NAILING

If you google ""screwing into cellular concrete"" you will find lots of examples of normal screws being driven into the cellular concrete. The interior walls of bioceramic domes are a cellular ceramic with micro cellulose fibers, and the ceramic is an inorganic polymer (unlike concrete). Screws will hold extremely well. We can even ""pot"" screws and nails or dowels into the wall for very strong anchors. (""potting"" is drilling a hole that is about 40% bigger than the dowel, and filling it with wet ceramic, then pushing the dowel into the wet ceramic so it oozes out, creating a very strong bond. ""Epoxy potting"" is often used in the world of wood boat building. Epoxy is an organic polymer. Same principle here, but with the inorganic ceramic polymer.)

WHEN WILL GEOSHIP BE PROFITABLE?
We expect to reach profitability as soon as our pilot plant begins operation - which is 6-12 months.

PROJECTED NUMBER OF DOMES SOLD?
Demand for the domes far exceeds our production capacity, and we expect this will be the case for at least the next 5-10 years. Capacity of our pilot plant will be at least 2 small domes per month. We're aiming to be in full production within 36 months - with capacity 120 small domes per month. The next step after full production is to scale 3 more full production plants simultaneously, around the US and in Iceland to start serving Europe. The data we've collected indicates there will be an enormous global market for bioceramic domes.

Is it easy for homeowners to put up nails and hangers for decorations themselves? Same question for interior decorations? How do people hang picture frames on ceramic walls? Thanks!","The interior walls are cellular ceramic. They can be screwed/nailed into and will hold pretty well, especially if the screw is first dipped in wet ceramic. Holes can be filled in with the same ceramic material mixed at home. On the outside we would recommend using an adhesive or semi-permanent anchor spot, rather than screwing or nailing into it temporarily.

If you drive a nail into the fiber-ceramic composite, a hole will form, not a crack or shatter as people might expect with a ceramic material.

What have you done to get this type of construction approved for urban folks? Thanks.","Hi Helen - Our domes are being designed and engineered to meet the International Residential Codes. Technically they are considered a ""geodesic dome built with high-strength fiber-reinforced alternative concrete structural insulation panels, with cellular ceramic insulation"".

Domes like this have been installed all over the US already, by a company called ""AI Domes"". Sadly, the owner of AI Domes recently died, and the company shut down, after being in operation for around 40 years and installing many domes.

In the eyes of the building departments, our design is similar to AI Domes. We are just using a better ceramic material, and precision cast panels, which creates a very different look and feel. AI Domes were built with EPS foam insulation and portland concrete, then covered in latex.

We expect our domes will meet codes and be permitted almost anywhere in the world. The utility hookups can be very similar to a conventional home.

The only limitation we are aware of will be in existing neighborhoods that have convenants which force all homes to look the same. However, we believe even these will relax as the bioceramic geodesic homes become more normalized over the next decade.

Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Wineetha Fernando,42,Yes,a month ago,"Would the geoships withstand winters in Colorado, Are they elevated so that it withstands flooding .How is heating and cooling maintained . Also I am interested in sewer and water supply.Do they need a sewer system and wells to provide water in the rural areas. That would cost about $20,000 additional expense.
thank you for your answers.","Hi Wineetha,

Yes, bioceramic domes will be EXCELLENT in the Colorado winters.

Very low operational energy.
The R-value per inch of cellular ceramic insulation is higher than conventional fiberglass insulation. Thermal bridging is minimal because bioceramic domes do not have frames. The dome creates a very tight envelope that lends itself perfectly well to air exchange by natural convection (rather than by disruptive fans). The ceramics also reflect over 80% of the sun’s radiation, forming a highly efficient “cool roof”. The electrochromic glass and automated vents will work with strategically placed thermal masses in the interior walls/floor to assist the dome in heating/cooling itself passively. The savings in operational energy also extend well beyond your monthly heating/cooling costs. We expect maintenance costs for the all-ceramic home will be extremely low. Based upon the material properties, we expect it to require nothing more than the occasional wash down. Damage can be easily repaired using the bioceramic itself, as it bonds to itself like a tenacious waterproof glue.

Minimizes surface area.
A two story, 1,500 sqft bioceramic dome has 30% to 50% less surface area than a 1,500 sqft two story box house (rectangles and more complex box shapes have more surface area than a square box shape). This translates into 30% to 50% less material cost (or more because bioceramic domes are precast with zero waste), and 30% to 50% more insulation. There is a direct correlation between surface area and insulative value. The geodesic dome is the “lightest, strongest, most efficient means of enclosing space known to man”, this is according to the American Institute of Architects. Now that we have the correct material technology for its construction, the geodesic dome will never be beaten.

The foundation, sewer, and water supply options are the same as any other home. The dome can be built on a slab, a rubble trench foundation with cob floors, or on a platform. We recommend using helical piers to attach the dome to the foundation or to attach the platform to the earth.

Water and sewer is all sub-floor, with many possible options. We will offer some composting toilet options, and bio-membrane sewage options that will go particularly well with the dome. We also plan to offer a whole dome water filtration system that will first filter the water to 0 parts per million, then ""renature"" the water using a vortex process. So the water you drink and shower with in a dome will be the best water possible.

Hope this answers your questions :-)

do you plan to ship it to Europe as well? If yes, can you tell more about the shipping costs and would it be possible to order the installation and interior finishing?

Thanks,

Alex","Hi Alex,

Yes, we plan to ship to Europe when we start full production in 2022. We also plan to set up plants in Europe, so shipping will not be necessary in the future.

The whole dome and all the interior finishings can be packed into a standard shipping container, so you can check the prices of shipping from the US west coast to your location.

Installations in Europe will be done either by Geoship certified installation crews. Or by owner-builders. Every piece of the bioceramic dome is precision casted, and no piece weighs more than 30 lbs. So the installation is like assembling a piece of Ikea furniture, and can be done by almost anyone.

The transitional (homeless) village model actually requires that Geoship is mainstream, because the transitional village building is partially fueled by revenue.

Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Nam Nguyen,,Yes,a month ago,"Hello, mirroring the other comments, be nice to see touch and feel an actual product.

Additionally:

How do you envision scaling to larger sizes and the prices per sq foot? How big can these domes get and how much could say 1000 sqft cost?

I saw an article that has a dome going for $200/sqft, considering being in Vegas, that could be a good price point but this price point may not work in all areas such as Louisiana where the price per sqft could be less than half of your current domes.

Could these domes be used for protection from hurricanes or maybe even tornados?","Hi Nam,

We're planning on 3 dome sizes (see sizes in architecture business model section above) that all interconnect. We will probably not go over the 36' diameter dome. It has 950sf on first floor, and around 450 on the second floor (generally the bigger domes will have 50% lofts). Most single family dome homes will be 2-3 domes. So many combinations are possible - a home any size from 2,000 sf up to 4,000 sqft.

Domes are like any home, the smaller the size, the higher the cost per sf.

The $200/sf number is turnkey price for a 200sf dome fully installed and finished. There is enough margin in that price that we can DONATE domes to a transitional village with the profits (see link above near the Zappos video).

Bioceramic domes are a mass production technology. We believe they will enable the leap onto a new housing affordability curve. Prices and Costs will fall significantly in the future. There is also the potential for owner-builders to do some of the installation and finish work. Which will decrease costs as well.

Our long term goal is to reduce the cost of housing all across the US back down to 2.5x median income. We believe that's possible with our technology.

Yes, they should be very good protection from hurricanes and tornadoes. We'll see how the testing goes when we start pilot production. But if the dome cannot withstand a tornado, we will identify the points of failure and make them stronger, until we can offer domes that are able to withstand the very worst tornadoes and hurricanes. The foundation system we use is ""helical piers"" which have proven very effective in hurricanes and earthquakes.....in addition to the ceramic geodesic design.

Hope that answers your question.

We estimate it will take 6-12 months to finish an iterative prototyping process and have a beautiful finished dome, AND the ability to begin pilot production of at least 2 domes per month.

The very first dome will be installed near our headquarters in Nevada City, CA. We also have an investor on Whidbey Island WA who purchased a dome as a gift, to serve as a mediation space at a Tibetan Buddhist temple on South Whidbey. Zappos also wants to install validation prototypes near their campus in downtown Las Vegas. Finally another investor/advisor purchased a dome that will be installed near Sebastopol, CA.

Our strategy with the validation prototypes is to install them at various locations around the US - in the primary geographic markets we're targeting (creative centers).

When we begin pilot production, we will open reservations. The first 10-50 domes will be installed in these select locations — beautiful settings where they can be visited or even stayed in overnight.

After we have produced at least 10 tiny domes, we will start developing the bigger domes.

Geoship,https://www.startengine.com/geoship,Miguel Costa,3,No,a month ago,"Hello again,
Thank you very much for the quick response.
I do have a couple more questions for the time being.

- Having in consideration that you have a new mold, what type of tests have you performed on the finish product? And why not make another prototype Geoship before passing to the real thing?
- The square footage is a little bit small.. do you have a general, or detail, picture of where people are wanting your Geoship?


Best regards,
Miguel Costa","Hi Miguel :-)

To answer your questions:

1) We did a structural analysis of the panel, to understand the weakest points, then designed the mold to strengthen those areas with minimal added weight. We are raising capital to make a full set of molds (each dome requires multiple molds) and purchase the equipment that's needed for a pilot plant. This is specialized equipment we are fabricating and part of our IP.

We have no doubt at all the material and geodesic structure will meet and exceed structural requirements. The material has been proven in the field as described ""first mover advantage"" section above and it is extremely high strength. According to the American Institute of Architects the geodesic dome is ""the lightest, strongest, most efficient means of enclosing space known to man."" So we are using incredibly strong and safe materials and geometry.

The full set of molds we're currently fabricating will be to build a ""validation prototype"" (the next step after the ""engineering prototype""). We will produce at least 20 validation prototypes, and sell them to early customers.

------

2) The three dome sizes listed above can all be connected to one another. A 2+ bedroom geodesic home will typically be multiple domes. This is modular construction, which enables us to build homes of any size. Lots of configurations are possible.

We've found strong demand among ""cultural creatives"" in artistic towns. Our most enthusiastic customers are change makers and thought leaders with an ecological or spiritual focus. Also people who love to maximize efficiency, and people who want a ""modern earth home"". We believe our ""niche"" will grow into becoming the mainstream over the next 5-10 years.

Hope this helps to answer your questions!

Thanks for your questions. Since the initial PR in August, our focus has been 90% on product development and fundraising, rather than market development. We've done no paid advertising and little social media. Traction since August has been 1) The letter of intent from first community 2) RFP submitted to Clark County 3) Project Sales Pipeline increased by another $130m (850 signups in the last 3 months).

It’s likely we will extend this campaign goal to $1M."
Grady's Cold Brew,https://www.startengine.com/gradyscoldbrew,Josh Luddeni,,No,7 days ago,"Love Gradys, appreciate the fundraising. Since I have the direct ear of management through this, one thing I always felt like Grady's fell behind on was more variety or flavors of products, and more specifically Fall/Holiday themed beverages. Other Grady's competition have grabbed onto this and launched holiday and other seasonal cold brew flavors, I've always been more surprised that Grady's hasn't, how much research is going into more product or future flavors, it seems Grady's has played it more safe?","Hey Josh, thank you for your observation and question. A few points on this front...

1) With Grady's, I always wanted to make an iconic/recognizable flavor. Something people could drink from coast to coast (and even internationally), and recognize the flavor as Grady's immediately. I felt that coming out early with a lot of new flavors and variations can distract and dilute from that. I would never in a million years compare Grady's to Coca-Cola, but I often ask what that brand would look like if they immediately made Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Orange Vanilla, etc? Would Coke Classic be as ""classic"" without letting that flavor breath a little? Instead, we went for a unique approach of bringing our classic New Orleans–Style flavor to consumers in as many variations as possible. Everything from concentrates, single-serve bottles, bag-in-box, kegs, Bean Bags, etc. Now that the base flavor is more established, we are making variations of our original blend. A NOLA decaf version, French Vanilla, and Hazelnut Mocha. We are also looking to expand those more into the Bean Bag line starting with French Vanilla (we have been testing in Food Service).
2) Another reason we really push strongly with our original concentrate, is that coffee is arguably the most subjective beverage in the world. People customize it to their specific taste, and a concentrate really allows that. You can make your Grady's as strong, sweet, or flavored as you would like, based on what you mix into it. Instead of trying to make a specific product for every individual palate, we produce a unique base and allows you to go in any direction. This does not work the same for RTD single-serve products though. With those, you do need to make a variety of flavors (sweet, with dairy or non-dairy, nitro, soda, etc) and that is something we continue to look into.
3) As for seasonal flavors, I agree that these can give a holiday sales bump, but unfortunately, those obvious fall/winter flavors (pumpkin, peppermint) don't line up that well for iced coffee season. If there was an obvious seasonal summer flavor that worked well at the start of cold brew season, I would be more inclined to test that. I just haven't been that impressed with the citrus cold brews that have been released. 
4) And finally, from a production and inventory standpoint, adding a bunch of flavors/skus can be costly to produce for a company our size. There is a lot of money that goes into new packaging, R&D, etc, so we have been cautious in releasing too many new flavors. It's also tricky for a refrigerated product that has a 90day expiration date, where you could end up buying back a lot of product from retail accounts if they don't turn on the shelf quickly enough. 
The above all being said, we are constantly reevaluating our product lineup. Launching new skus becomes much easier as we built out our sales through the funds from this raise and can plug in new and seasonal flavors into our strongest sales channels. The main focus of this campaign is to grow our brand exponentially with what has proven to work for us and through that process we will have more leverage to implement new skus. 

I hope that helps answer your question Josh, and that you will come on board as an investor. Best, Grady"

I took a look through the filing documents - the losses aren't a surprise or a concern at this stage - the use of credit card debt was a little. Do you have any immediate plans to move that debt to something less costly/more orthodox - or is that a destination of some of the proceeds from this offering?

My main question, however relates to the rights associated with the Class B shares on offer. I see the voting rights - again am unconcerned and understand how they vary from Class A and that they exist at all at this phase in the company's maturity - I did however wonder (1) how this offering is protected from future dilution (e.g. will the investor retain their % ownership, will there be the chance to participate in rights issues, etc), and (2) how will Class B investors share in the future success of the organization, be it floatation or acquisition?

This gives Grady's a unique, but subtle flavor with a hint of all-natural sweetness (allowing our customers to enjoy without needing to add any or as much sugar). The concentrates also have unlimited possibilities to customize, so you are virtually guaranteed a perfect cup. And finally, our value makes us unique with servings going for less than a buck a cup (vs single serve cold brews or by-the-cup at a coffee shop). I would also encourage you to read some of the reviews of our product shown in the campaign or on Amazon to get our customers take on what makes us so special.

2) Yes, we have and will continue to explore all options for line extensions, but we definitely aren't a sku-crazy brand that introduces new flavors constantly. We really wanted to make a signature flavor (our Coke Classic if you will) that is available in multiple formats (RTD, concentrates, bag-in-box, Bean Bags, etc) and recognized coast to coast.

3) We did speak with a number of traditional VC Funds, but ultimately didn't feel it was the right fit for the culture of Grady's and the way we operate our business (steady growth, manufacturing in-house for quality, no forced exit, etc). Crowdfunding gives us much more control of the process, while also giving our long-time fans the opportunity to invest in something they love. The idea of having hundreds of brand ambassadors out there supporting Grady's is extremely appealing to us."
Grady's Cold Brew,https://www.startengine.com/gradyscoldbrew,Nicholas Caropreso,2,Yes,2 months ago,"Hi Grady's Cold Brew Team!

I am a big fan of your products. I started with the concentrate bottles, then moved on to trying the brew kits, and now I never leave for vacation without bringing a few kits. Quite honestly, I don't think there is anyone close on the quality side in the shelf stable or self-brew kit market. The options have been growing, but the quality options have never showed up.

As a consumer and customer, I want to blindly investment. But the investor side of me is weary after taking a look at the historical financials that appear to signal eroding margins and a growing imbalance of short-term liabilities.

With most of 2019 behind us, can you share some potential highlights from 2019 from a gross margin perspective?
Did 2018 consist of growing pains and 2019+ going to show the scaling of operations?
Are there any long-term initiatives that you can share that are part of bringing EBITDA to break-even potentially by 2020?
Also, can you provide any insight into the types of expenses that are part of Operating Expenses outside of the Selling and Administrative?

Thank you so much.

Nick","Hey Nicholas. Thanks for being a fan! We built a brewery to make sure we were maintaining our quality.

We get it! It’s not our mission to be a cash suck, and we believe we’ve shown great strides to building a sustainable business with the changes we have made in 2019. We expect this raise will take us a long way in growing our sales into quality retailers and channels, and scaling our business

Before answering your questions, it’s important to preface that 2019 is still ongoing, subject to change, and we are limited in what we can disclose prior to filing. But, to answer your questions:

As of Oct 31, 2019 we are showing YTD gross margins of 43%. 2018 did consist of growing pains and headwinds with increased competition stemming particularly from big brand acquisitions and their large spend to grow door count. Our concentration was to grow the business focusing on quality doors while paying close attention to improve our operational efficiencies. Once the period is closed, we expect to have already surpassed 2018 gross revenue as of Nov 30, 2019, while showing significant improvement in EBITDA. Our Q3 and YTD 2019 EBITA margin loss was (0.3%) vs (13%) in that same period of 2018.

We have high confidence that our planned introduction of new machinery (already in progress) will bring us closer to breakeven EBITDA. We expect it to show a material improvement in our gross margins by streamlining parts of our production processes. This could potentially occur within the next year.

Outside of COGs, freight, and SG&A, other opex include our payroll, storage space rent, vehicle expense, warehouse and auto repairs. We will, of course, be working to grow our revenue while keeping opex under control.

Best, Grady"
Grady's Cold Brew,https://www.startengine.com/gradyscoldbrew,Daniel Cacchione,,No,2 months ago,"Hi Grayson,
I have just a few questions for you.
1. Do you have any plans to expand your Lil Easy RTD line?
2. Why did Grady's choose to seek investment through a crowd funding site? And are you seeking investments through traditional methods?
3. What regions of the USA does Grady's Cold Brew currently have retail space in? What is the timeframe to expand into all regions of the USA? (If you're not already in all of them).

Thanks in advance for answering my questions!","Thanks for your questions Daniel. Best, Grady.

(1) We feel that the large-format concentrate offers consumers the most value and convenience, but do believe there is a lot of potential to expand the single-serve RTD lineup. We do produce a Lil Easy mixed with almond milk (right now, sold exclusively at the Harry Potter Broadway Show) that we would like to expand in the northeast and online in 2020. I could also see a nitro and oatmilk version selling well.

(2) We did speak with a number of traditional VC Funds, but ultimately didn't feel it was the right fit for the culture of Grady's and the way we operate our business (steady growth, manufacturing in-house for quality, no forced exit, etc). Crowdfunding gives us much more control of the process, while also giving our long-time fans the opportunity to invest in something they love. The idea of having hundreds of brand ambassadors out there supporting Grady's is extremely appealing to us.

(3) We sell our product in five regions of Whole Foods (Northeast, North Atlantic, Southwest, NorCal, and Rocky Mountains) and soon to be Mid Atlantic in spring 2020. We are available at Publix in the Southeast, Sprouts and HEB in the Southwest, Meijer in the Midwest, Target in the Northeast, and Walmart across the country (1200 stores)."

Grady's Cold Brew,https://www.startengine.com/gradyscoldbrew,Shawn Jang,,No,2 months ago,"1) What is your plan for monetization down the road (and do you have a time frame)? Do you plan to sell the business or try to take the company public one day?

2) Will investors receive some sort of financial reporting docs over time, and how frequently?

3) Would you ever expand beyond just cold brews? Any other beverage types?

4) Do you have any plans to build a brick-and-mortar presence one day?

5) Any international expansion plans?

6) What sort of governance do you have for the company? Any Board of Directors, Observers or Advisors?","Hi Shawn, thank you for your interest and questions. Please see below. Thanks, Grady

1) We expect to balance both growth and profitability.  Much of the capital we expect to raise will be put towards growth initiatives, but we are mindful of the return on that spending. Early projections have us potentially breakeven in 2020 (although there are obviously no guarantees), which will allow us to operate the business without raising large amounts of outside capital, thereby avoiding dilution to new investors. My goal is to grow the business to a profitable $10M in revenue before entertaining all options to continue running Grady's or potentially exit.

2) By law, an issuer that sold securities in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering is required to provide an annual report on Form C-AR no later than 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The report must be filed on EDGAR and posted on the issuer's website. As of now, we plan on providing quarterly reports to investors as we have been doing for the last two years.

3) We will of course always entertain line extensions outside of cold brew (we have cold brewed some great teas lately!), but our immediate focus is expanding the amount of doors our large-format liquid concentrates (by far our flagship product) are available in.

4) This is something we have considered and will continue to entertain. Especially in the potential form of a seasonal pop-up in NYC. Again, it is not our main focus with this raise, but there is definitely potential for that in the future.

5) Grady's Cold Brew has already been shipped and sold in Canada, UK, France, Australia, Japan, Lebanon, and Hong Kong. Because of the high cost of shipping a perishable liquid, all sales have been with the dry, shelf-stable Bean Bag products. We are currently able to ship world-wide though our website too.

6) Yes, we have an active Board of Directors (pictured in the Team Section of the campaign) and are always willing to take on project-based consultants to help the company from time to time."

PaQuí Tequila,https://www.startengine.com/paquitequila,Wardell Carter,18,Yes,a month ago,"I ordered a bottle of the Silvera Tequila from Mission Liquors and it was amazing.

I placed a second order, but it would be great to have local access to Paqui.","Thank you for the kind comments about PaQui!

PaQuí Tequila,https://www.startengine.com/paquitequila,John Easton,,No,a month ago,"Can you please advise me how you came to an $8.0 million valuation for this company. Based on your last twelve month sales of $53 thousand, this results in a multiple of more than 150x sales. Recent sales of craft distilleries to large industry players have been in the 10-15 x revenue range. In order for a major player to have interest in purchasing a brand it needs to have some critical mass in the marketplace. When Cos Amigos was purchased it had sold 130,000 cases the prior year. High West Distillery was purchased after it reached 70,000 cases a year. How do you plan on getting to these types of sales? Additionally, if my math is correct you have approximately $2.0 million in debt that comes in front of this equity offering and just over $13 thousand in cash on the balance sheet. The valuation just dosn't seem realistic.","Yes, the 2018 revenue is modest because we sold in a limited area as a test of the brand potential. NYC is considered the most competitive market in the US and the test demonstrated potential for strong growth when we expand to new states. By raising money we will be able to expand to many new markets and increase marketing spend to drive sales. 2019 revenue has increased 191% through November with sales still almost entirely in NYC.

A comparison to craft spirits is not really appropriate: the brand may be craft size now but has clearly shown that it can compete with the dominant tequila brands - Patron, Don Julio and Casamigos - in the market in NYC where the accounts almost always place PaQui next to these brands. The decision makers at retailers and bars/restaurants are signaling that PaQui can compete by placing it next to the billion dollar brands. So unlike craft spirits, PaQui has the potential to be a national brand with significant volume potential. The brand was developed through consumer research to compete directly with the dominant brands.

The other point would be that high end tequila brands can often achieve very high valuations. I know of a tequila brand that sold ten plus years ago for over $2M before it had any sales based only on the TM and package.

The Founder/CEO has invested several million.

I understand that the valuation can appear to be high based on current results, but the quality of the brand/ liquid and its proven potential to compete in a fast growing segment against the top three brands goes a long way toward justifying the valuation.

Reaching a volume level of 70k cases or more is possible by expanding to 25 to 30 states while using relatively efficient social media marketing to create awareness and trial. For this crowdfunding effort alone, our SM will reach about 4 million tequila drinkers. And we have an initial relationship in NY with a wholesaler network ( 4th largest in US ) that competes in 25 more states - a potential avenue for the expansion we need."

To me it's a sort of gimmick, clever marketing. But i am interested in continually upgrading our aged styles and am considering using very French oak to achieve a more delicate wood character.

I believe the aged styles should still reflect the base ingredient - agave. So many brands' aged styles are dominated by wood and have lost all the agave character.

We are most proud of our Silvera which has great agave character, sweet fruit on the front and then a lot more flavors like vanilla, pepper, minerals and smoke."

Would you mind giving more information on the supply of the Blue Weber Agave 7+ yr old plants?
How many bottles of Tequila per plant?
Do you own any Agave farms?
How far forward is your supply of Agave plants?
Could the Big Two companies lock you out of supply of plants?
I'm just trying to get a handle on any future supply problems.
Your product sounds great, thanks for your time,
Jeff","We believe we are in a good position regarding agave for a few reasons:
- the distillery we use also grows agave, .not enough to rely solely on those agaves but for some of want we need
- we do not own farms but we have relationships with growers. The agaves are a commodity and what is important for the quality of PaQui is that the plant be around 26 brix, which means a mature plant.
- the Master Distiller of PaQui has decades of experience and connections to many growers.
- the other director, Javier Martinez, also has superb connections in the tequila world
- the price of agave has risen very high , but there is supply of the agave we need at the higher price
- it's about 5 kilos of agave per 750ml bottle. And agave plants can be from 40 to 80 kilos
- the big two companies could not lock us out. They account for a huge amount of the luxury tequila volume, but if all tequila is taken into account, they do not dominate the supply.
- supply is not a trivial issue but the pattern in the past is that when the agave prices rise dramatically, the growers increase their planting which eventually drives the prices back down. The cycle can take a few years but it has always happened that way.
- interestingly, some of big brands are now taking agaves prior to maturity, which makes their liquid profiles suffer.
- so aside from the high price, I do not worry that much about agave supply. It may deter new brands, which is not a bad thing for us.
-distribution, sales and marketing are the true determinants of success"

WaterBlocks,https://www.startengine.com/llbusa,Jamie Hughis,7,Yes,2 months ago,"Hey Joe.
Here is a wierd suggestion. I dont know if you get much time to watch tv, but these blocks could be a valuable asset to the team on ""The Curse Of Oak Island"" (#1 cable series). A 200yr+ quest to uncover treasures on an island in Nova Scotia. If you have not seen it, take some time to watch a few episodes from this season. They could benefit greatly by using these to drain portions of the swamp, or any of the many water retention needs that they have. They are spending millions in their quest to solve the Oak Island mysteries. You really need to watch the show to understand.
If production is within reach, it could be a major opportunity for national recognition of the waterblocks. According to the network (History Channel) it is #1 cable series on TV. Look into contacting the Lagina brothers to present the waterblocks system to them as a reusable and easily deployable alternative to the systems they are currently using. I think it would make a lot of sense to them to have the waterblocks at their disposal. If you can get these to them, the exposure that LLB and waterblocks could get could potentially be astronomical promotion of the product.
Like I said, you really need to take the time to watch this season (which is currently airing) to understand what I am talking about.
Call me crazy, but I really think it could be truly beneficial to the company's progress. They may even be able to speed up the process with monitary contributions if they can realize the application possibilities for their quest.

I did the $500 investment and are in a ""funds invested state"", when I will receive the two soapsoax and the 10% off code, I would love to give them to some kids in my community!","Hi Matthew, Thank you for your compliments and investment. Your two SoapSox are scheduled to go out this week along with those of other investors. You will receive a welcome email with the investor code to get your discount. I appreciate you sharing SoapSox with the kids in your community. Also, be on the lookout for our new Target commercial which begins airing this week. Cheers!"
SoapSox,https://www.startengine.com/soapsox,luciano ferreira,17,No,23 days ago,"Great product, fair evaluation, but share price I think it’s 2 higher. I woundering why .","Hi Luciano, Thanks for the feedback. We also believe we have a great product and fair valuation. We also believe our share price is fair but misleading if you don't pay attention to the details. We only issued 1 million shares for the company, which on this platform gives the appearance of a higher share price than average, but the value is what really matters. Other companies issue 4-5 million shares which reduces their overall share price but the value is also reduced. Investors then ""feel"" like their getting more value with a higher number of shares, but again that is not the case. Given our growth, the upside for investors is that our relatively limited shares allows for a bigger upside given the shares are not diluted. Hope this helps clarify things."

We weren't too thrilled about the two deals offered as well which is why we decided to push on without them. However, we must say the Sharks and folks at Shark Tank were awesome. We appreciate you joining the family at a time that we are expanding our partnerships and entering our growth phase. We believe that current timing provides a great win win scenario for the company and investors. Cheers!"
SoapSox,https://www.startengine.com/soapsox,Helen Ruan,,No,a month ago,"Hi Ray, in the case of acquisition, it's the exit valuation price and % of ownership really matters to founders. Individual share price can fluctuate up and down due to a number of factors at acquisition. Setting share price for investors in this round at $7.75 exposes investors to more risks, unless you can guarantee that share price will be much higher than $7.75 / share at acquisition, and you probably can't guarantee that. Companies intend to go IPO on NASDAQ or NYSE need share price to be above certain value in order to get listed but that doesn't apply to Soapsox. Many investors here could become your customers to help you grow your revenue faster, become your ambassadors to help you organically increase brand awareness, save you marketing spend, and help you increase valuation. It could have been a win win situation if the share price is more reasonable and you have anti-dilution set up for founders. You did take one shark's advice by lowering product price, but you seem to be repeating the same pattern of not really letting other people help you grow quicker. It's understandable that every founder thinks their hard work is worth a lot more but you seem to be overly concerned about investors taking advantage of the founders, which is certainly not the case with crowdfunding. I do admire your tenacity, building a successful business without Sharks' investments. God bless.","Helen, We do want to minimize risk to our investors and although we can't guarantee share prices will be higher at acquisition (2-3 years), we are doing our best to position ourselves so that they will. Our sales and growing partnerships indicate we are on the right track and we added the 10% bonus shares to reduce the actual current per share cost to $6.97. However you make an excellent point in regards to it being a win win situation. We will look at our options so that our current and future investors have greater reduced risk and we have the resources to grow the business larger and faster. Thank you for the great strategy suggestions, and kind words."
SoapSox,https://www.startengine.com/soapsox,Helen Ruan,,No,a month ago,"Hi, If you're truly planning for acquisition, then the valuation of this round and the exit valuation price matter the most. This seems to be a common pattern for deals that got attention on Sharks Tank, setting share price at $7+ on crowdfunding sites, which end up raising much slower and less than companies with less market traction. You probably could have raised a lot more and quicker if the share price is much lower, like $1.5~$2.0. If you're concerned about founder's share dilution, then just give the founding team more shares (e.g. performance-based shares) without going down the route of issuing fewer shares with inflated share price on crowdfunding sites. My 2 cents.","Hi Helen,
Thanks for your input. We are positioning ourselves for acquisition. While I agree that we likely would have raised faster and perhaps more with a reduced share price. I disagree we are going the route you described. We provide 10% bonus shares which reduces share price, and already have a potential buyer. We also are a young company and are expanding partnerships with Walmart, Target, and Amazon. So while there are other companies with lower share prices, we believe the value & opportunity is in our unique product, our patents (domestic and international), who we are as people (our brand story), and where we are going.
Happy New Year!"

You feel that even without this raise you can stay in business in perpetuity? Also, a new question: Can you give a little more specific information about what your utility patent covers? Thanks! (p.s. There is a comment that mentions your price per share in a negative light, and I commend you for your transparent answer to that question. It should also be noted that PPS alone is a meaningless number so I'm not sure why there was a complaint in the first place. You could have chosen to release 600,000 shares at $10, 300,000 shares at $20, or 6,000,000 shares at $1 and it would all mean the same thing. Valuation is the number that has meaning. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but your sales this year should be 1.5M, at 100% growth y/y, making a 6M valuation reasonable.)","Hi Alan, We are currently cashflow positive, however we are looking to expedite growth which is why we are doing this raise. In regards to our patents we have both design and utility patents. As you are probably aware the utility covers the functional features of our product. Specifically the “mouth feeding” of soap, and the “finger pockets” features of our product. This also is what has been the key feature kids love about our product and what give us a unique competitive advantage. Lastly, I did want to follow up regarding your previous question of our 1.2M in loans. Just under 50% will be converted into equity, thus reducing our obligations to only produce $600k in surplus over the next 28 months. Lastly, we are positioning ourselves to hit 1.2+M in sales with support from this raise which is inline with our valuation. Thank you for also elaborating on PPS. Cheers!"

I would have certainly bought your product when my kids were younger. Also, I really like your background - this morning I am headed to an event at a residential facility very much like the one you worked at. My main questions revolve around why you are here. With such success and projected growth I'm not sure why you'd want or need to give away part of your company. You have 1.2M in loans due in the next two years, yet you say that just 10K is enough to keep you perpetually in business. This suggests that with only 10K (an amount you could get fairly easily in debt funding) you can produce a 1.2M+ surplus over the next 28 months. Can you share more detail about why you chose this route (beyond the usual ""we wanted to share our success with the public, and/or we wanted brand ambassadors"", because when companies give those answers I always wonder about their business acumen). Thanks!","Hi Alan, Thanks for your compliment and question. We are here seeking funding from investors who ""get"" our product and recognize where we are going, with an valuation and terms that are fair to the investor and company. We have learned very quickly that despite our successes, securing funding from VC's involves fighting tooth and nail for reduced valuation and in the end your giving up more equity than you would like. We were not implying that we could with $10k produce 1.2M+ in surplus over the next 28 months. This raise is only the first phase, of our two phase plan to raise $1M on the StartEngine platform. We have had success at securing great partnerships with retailers and premier licensors.

With regards to your question on conversion, the conversion terms for the preferred stock being offered are that each of the CF Convertible Preferred shares will automatically convert into Common Stock on June 30, 2020 on a 1:1 basis (subject to adjustment as noted in the Elective Conversion shown below) in the event the Company has not received a notification of qualification of a Regulation A offering. In the event a Regulation A offering has received a notification of qualification on or before June 30, 2020, then the CF Convertible Preferred shares shall automatically convert to Common Stock at that time on the same basis. There is no guarantee that the Regulation A offering will be filed but the CF Convertible Preferred shares will convert to common stock no later than June 30,2020.

Elective Conversion. Each of the holders of the CF Convertible Preferred shares shall have the right, at his, her or its sole election, to convert each share held by such holder and all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (if any) into such number of 1 share of Common Stock for each CF Convertible Preferred share outstanding (subject to equitable adjustment to account for forward and reverse stock splits, consolidations and other extraordinary corporate events (as provided in the Certificate of Designations).

We are pleased to share progress made by the Company over the last several months:
In August and September of 2019, the Company received patent allowances in China, Russia and the EU. In November of 2019, the patent in China was issued and published in the Chinese Patent Gazette. The allowed claims cover the use of cerium oxide nanoparticles for the reduction of side effects caused by radiation therapy for patients with pancreatic or lung cancer, who are receiving radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. We were thrilled to begin to build our international patent portfolio in such significantly large regions of the globe and believe side effects from radiation are certainly not limited to the US. To further expand our scope of patent coverage in China, Russia and the EU, divisional patent applications were filed in October and November of 2019 to include claims for cancers of the breast, ovarian, head and neck, and/or colon cancer.
In 2019 BioCurity sought out additional consultants with deep combined experience in preclinical and clinical development strategy, regulatory (FDA) protocol development and clinical trial execution including a physician with extensive clinical research experience including but not limited to breast cancer. The group of consultants adjusted the proposed clinical trial for the BioCurity’s BC 101, a topical drug to prevent skin dermatitis for breast cancer patients. Our consultants recommended that the total number of participants in the proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial be reduced from 338 to 84 and include breast cancer patients for the safety portion (Phase 1) of the trial. BioCurity is seeking funding to complete the testing required by the FDA to file an Investigational New Drug Application.

1. Do you anticipate issuing additional units or having a secondary round of funding which could dilute or adversely affect current investor's holdings?

2. 70- 80% of movies fail to make a profit. How do you intend to attempt to defy this statistic especially given that this is a low budget indie film?

3. It says investors are being paid with net profits. Historically speaking after payments are made to the production company and other partners and entities there are usually no net profits left to distribute to the movie shell corp or llc.

How likely is it that investors are going to be repaid their principal and earn a return? What fail-safes do you have in place in order to avoid the historical outcome of everything going to the production companies and other entities while excluding everyone else?

Thank you in advance for your time and response.

Kind regards,

Corinthius C. Moffitt","Hello Corinthius,
Thanks so much for your thoughtful questions!
1. We have stated our target budget and don't plan to go beyond that. As the units sold via Startengine are essentially revenue rights, any subsequent investment rounds will have the same revenue share rights as this round (on the same terms).

2. Many producers are capable of making a profitable business out of the film industry. Others are not so successful. This does not stop people from producing low quality films in all parts of the world and hoping to get into Sundance. The best way to make money with a feature film is to have a film that can sell in all territories, and action-adventure films lead this market. Also, of course, the film has to be good and made by professionals, with recognizable talent. We have delivered on this in the past with our work. Because making an action film is more challenging than a slow-burn drama, we are lucky to have made a proof-of-concept covering the most difficult aspects production-wise of the story.

3. Wear open to the possibility that a big actor will put some debt on the film in terms of their fee, but that is worst case scenario and would have to justify large pre-sales. When you say ""historically speaking"", I think you are referring to smaller budget films which are often dramas, comedies, or dramedies, which are harder to sell internationally. We also aim to produce a high quality action film at a lower budget than other similar films, partly by taking lower salaries and doing more with high quality VFX.

At the end of the day, it's about who you trust. We have put our names all over this project and will stand by it. Our team has a combined experience producing over 60 feature films with major stars in outlets you've heard of (check out our team on imdb). Our reputation is on the line with this film and we are confident it will be profitable.
Best, Max"

Kind regards,

Corinthius Moffitt","Hello Corinthius,
Thanks for your questions. Here is my response:
1. What sort of accounting method will be used Hollywood, GAAP, etc.?
We will use GAAP accounting methods. We are no fans of ""Hollywood"" accounting where profit takes 50 pages to define.
2. How soon do you plan on generating a return for investors?
Within 6 months after the release of our film. We expect to reach profitability by the 3rd ""cable"" window.
3. What happens to investors if there is a future reboot or someone else buys the rights to the movie or its intellectual property etc?
Investors participate in this buyout just as if it were revenue. The underlying IP is owned by the LLC. As there are 2 sequels and a tv pilot, this IP would become valuable if the film were very successful.
4. How often will investors be paid annually quarterly etc?
Quarterly. We have structured the LLC to make royalty payments simple via a 1099 on an electronic service such as square.
5. Do you have any potential earnings estimates and how would they correlate as yield on a per share basis to possible investors?
We do have 3rd party earnings estimates from our sales agent, Moonrise Pictures. We are not allowed to show this because of SEC compliance issues, but can share privately to investors.
6. Are returns paid in perpetuity?
Yes.
7. Do you have a completion bond?
No. We are going to avoid this if possible because it's expensive and comes with its own compliance headaches. But there is a chance our investment partners will require this further along in the process. We are also on the small side for a completion bond.
8. Are you pursuing any tax incentives?
Absolutely and that is an important factor in our financing. Our consulting producer Houston King is a wiz at this stuff and knows many film commissions personally.
9. Are film revenues being used to pay investors first?
We pay investors with film profits, not revenues. But we don't want to accumulate debt on the film as that would hurt our share as well, and we are limited in any case because we need to fall under the SAG Low budget agreement ($2.5 million and under).
10. How will any SAG-AFTRA regulations effect profitability, film schedules, revenues, and investor returns?
The regulations will affect anything and everything. Our budget target of $2.5 million, of which $1 million will be equity, was made to get the most bang-for-the buck from actor salaries. SAG-AFTRA is more flexible at this level and it will make our costs less, such as being allowed to use non-union extras. There is no way around dealing with SAG-AFTRA but we are highly experienced with the regulations and paperwork and have a great relationship with SAG-AFTRA."

And you will also get to see how the mafia make its money. We haven't announced it yet, but we will be adding another credit of ""Affiliate Producer"" for investors at the $2,500 level. Rest assured your name will be up on the big screen for our Thank You credits at any investment level (and imdb). You are also entitled to a signed copy of the screenplay. Thanks!"
Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,John William Auer,2,Yes,5 months ago,I missed the Gramercy event. Will you be having another one? When will I see this movie on my IMDB page?,"Hello John, Thanks for your question. We will not make an IMDB page until the film is within a month or two of the premiere. The reason is because the imdb page dates the film and it will lower the chances of a bidding war if distributors feel the film has been around for awhile (and they might falsely assume others have rejected it). I feel bad about this because I know it's important to many investors, but we need to consider the potential investment return first and foremost. I'm sorry because I know that's not what you want to hear, but it's a mistake to do otherwise for independent films.
As for another event, I really wanted to do one in LA but got a sprained ankle and had to cut the trip to 48 hours. It's very possible we can do another, but have no immediate plans. After the film comes out, we will have plenty of film events that will most likely offer free food and other perks. Our short film had 5 events in LA alone including one on the Paramount lot, with many others in NYC and festivals in Europe (26 festivals total). We are allowing all of our investors to attend these events with full access and it will be an opportunity to meet the cast, crew, and other backers. Also, these screening events are often attended by famous actors from my experience. Please stay tuned to our page for more announcements. Thanks again for your investment!"

I notice that you'll be part of the AFM in Santa Monica this year. I've worked it twice in the past; once for the Hollywood Reporter. Will you need any help this year like passing out cards, portfolios, pamphlets? Let me know; maybe I can help.","Hello Waide, Thanks so much for your comment! We were at AFM last year and they have been using my photo oddly enough to market themselves. We found a sales agent at AFM and therefore won't return to any markets until the film is complete. So we will not be at AFM this November. Thanks for your offer as there will be plenty of opportunities to get involved in the future!"
Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,Alan Jacobson,30,No,6 months ago,"Hi, I've been watching with interest since the very beginning, and I'm happy to see your latest update! I was hoping to get clarification on the wording. You mention that you can start shooting the film based on money raised here and elsewhere, but is there enough to fund filming and editing all of the movie and then marketing and distributing it? If not, what would be the plan for that, and if so, are there any changes from your original plan for filming, editing and marketing that you'll have to follow because of the lower amount raised? Thanks, and best of luck!","Hello Alan, Thanks for your note and well wishes! We have enough money pledged to complete production. That does not include post production, however. In a worse case scenario we could do this all ourselves including the VFX. (Here is a recent commercial for Paramount Network in which I completed all the VFX myself: https://vimeo.com/347148505). Licensing copyright free classical music is fairly cheap and would be less than $5k from our experience. Alternatively, we could make an agreement with a company like Goldcrest Pictures to complete all our post in exchange for taking the first earnings, but we would never want to take that deal because they would charge a premium (and we are too sophisticated for that). To market a limited theatrical release, spending only on the media buys and not asset creation which we can do ourselves (and without a publicist), we would need a minimum of $15k-$20k. But again, if we absolutely had to, we could sell our film to a distributor and let them handle the marketing, which would likely not be the most efficient given our expertise in this area (our team has distributed directly to theaters including AMC, Cinemark, Regal, etc). Bottom line is that we would still want to raise more money in post at this point because we want to earn the most for investors and ourselves, but we have options available if that fails. We plan to issue more detailed updates shortly. One major factor on our production plans is a possible recession which, from our experience, will reduce our costs for locations, equipment, and crew (but not actors) by more than half. (During the 2009 recession, I had an excellent crew for 2 months at near minimum wage levels.) There have also been changes in our production plans to make better use of the money as far as locations go, but that is because of our research and not any specific developments. At this point, the plan is to divide production between NYC (for bars and city exteriors) and LA (sound stages and movie ranches). We haven't hired a line producer yet so these production plans are not finalized."

Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,Yoav Getzler,17,No,8 months ago,"I’m interested in investing in your interesting project. However, I will not support any production that shoots or plans to shoot in Georgia given the assault on Women’s reproductive health. Are there other states with attractive production incentives that you know of?","Hello Yoav, Thank you for your comment. We are keeping an eye on this and have seen how the industry has reacted, which would no doubt also affect the talent. Should the situation with Georgia continue, we will not shoot there (nor would we be able because of talent requirements). Our sole interest in shooting in Georgia was for its tax benefits and comparable benefits exist in Ohio and Louisiana. State film tax benefits are continually changing, and in the case of California are based on a lottery system. Thus we cannot say precisely what state will work best for us when shooting begins. Note that this only affects our upper budget tiers. At the smaller budget levels we will shoot ""on location"" in New York (with some VFX/prison camp shot in LA county). Both states offer tax incentives that are competitive, thought not quite as generous as Ohio, Louisiana, Alaska, Massachusetts, and Georgia. We have spoken with the owners of soundstages in Louisiana and feel that the resources there are adequate."

My only thought is, why do you have to shoot the feature in color? Why not stay with the black & white? It looks rich, lush, profound and beautiful. There's always a depth in B & W that you don't get with color. Just my humble opinion. All in all, so proud to be a part of it.","Thank you so much Waide! Your investment and kind words mean a lot to me (and to us). As much as I love black and white films (silents are some of my favorites), we want our film to be as commercial as possible. It's hard enough to get the money that we want to make sure we do everything we can to get a wide release. A black and white film will need more marketing money (e.g. Roma) to get audiences excited enough to pay $ to watch it. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'm not willing to take that risk with other people's money. We shot the short in black and white largely because it was set in 1950, and we could not afford costumes that looked 100% believable. Because we had to rent costumes also, they couldn't be dirtied. Add to that AFI's restrictions on the use of actual Vor tattoos (!), so we had to use a different process. Thus, AFI's endless rules and regulations weakened our art department - which we covered up with the black and white. We anticipated these problems in the short and used the Red monochrome camera for most of the shoot - a camera that shoots only black and white. DP Terrence Burke also lit the short film specifically for black and white which looks amazing....Thanks again, Waide!"

Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,Alan Jacobson,30,No,a year ago,"Hi, I've been following this offer with interest, but my continuing concern is about the amount raised. What are your realistic funding options outside of this raise, and how far along are you in pursuing them? If you do close here but do not find other funding, I assume that this money may still be spent (i.e. not returned). I really hope you are successful, and to me your idea, experience, and your team are strong.","Hello Alan,
Thank you so much for this great question. I really appreciate your interest and the time you've spent following our progress, and of our course the nice things you've said about our project (and us). First of all, we will not disburse the money until we are 100% confident we can greenlight the film. That is a policy not shared by every startengine campaign and reflects our integrity. The $10k min. amount was a suggestion by Startengine in case we received money outside of their platform that met our own goal, allowing us to disburse if needed.
As for our marketing, we are being advised by Brad Rego from Cryptid, LLC who met his goal on Startengine. We've seen an uptick in momentum as our raise has increased, which we predicted. We expect this trend to continue. Our short term goal is to raise $100,000. At the $100,000 level, we will add to our ""retail"" fundraising with ""wholesale"" fundraising: 1. Hire a publicist to tell our story in media outlets. 2. Conduct an invitation-only VIP event a the Gramercy Park Hotel. This event will include a tour of the private park by me, the writer of a Rolling Stone article about the hotel's history, dinner, etc. We will not disburse funds to pay for this. We will seek corporate sponsors for food/dinner and pay out of our own pockets if necessary.
We have 2 investors who we think can greenlight the film. Like anyone else, they don't want to be the only investors. Unlike everyone else perhaps, they have given large amounts of money to films in the past (ones you've heard of) and have expressed an interest in funding Karaganda. They expect VIP treatment and events. One of these persons I've known for 20 years and has previously supported my work. We want to do things the right way, so that we guarantee our success. If we don't raise $100k by our deadline of course, we will need to extend the duration of our campaign.
Like a political campaign, we value not only the overall amount we raise, but the number of investors. Each investor is important to us both personally and as a selling point. We will definitely include all investors in at least one event. Our bigger investors however will have access to high level talent and the behind-the-scenes, which may be part of the reason they support the film. Any investor who is interested in breaking into the television or film industry will also have access to me, to help along their journey. My day job is at Paramount Network/TV Land in NYC and I have worked at many TV networks. Such is my gratitude to anyone who supports Karaganda that I will repay them with anything I can offer."
Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,Andrew Bushnell,51,Yes,a year ago,"Max, Thanks for the quick answer, I really think this project will be a winner if you can get the word out and it sounds like you have a plan in place to do just that.

I've been keeping a bit of a running list of crowdfunded movies if you were having trouble finding them for review on what you can learn from them (good as well as bad).

I did not know about the others! I will dig in. We are hoping to launch our marketing materials within the week. Please like our facebook page!
Karaganda,https://www.startengine.com/karaganda,Barnaby Zelman,16,No,a year ago,"I like the film's story and think you'll have a winner here if you can adequately fund. Given a realistic time frame from now until release & returns of about 3 years, the 15% bonus on capital investment seems very light in comparison to other past offerings. 50% would be great, and 30% would be reasonable...IMO. However I believe the risk of not reaching your $1M goal will be the biggest hurdle to getting early investors on board. A festival film is not what this investor is interested in. Here's hoping you can get to your funding goals. I'm definitely 'in' if you can pass the $700k mark at minimum.","Hello Barnaby,
Thank you for your comment and I'm grateful you reviewed our materials. This is not an investment for everyone. To be clear about the numbers, we need $476 to complete a film that is commercially available, though it will take us $700k to make a film at the quality level that would justify a larger (more marketing $) release. If we are stuck making a $476k film, which I think is unlikely, we will still earn returns in perpetuity. With a buyout from a streamer at this level (no marketing spend), I would expect the film to be profitable, but cannot promise that.
Your ROI is not limited to the 15% bonus plus recoupment, however, as you split profits afterward 50/50 with the producers pool. That is a fairly standard structure for independent feature films. If I myself were to invest in a feature film, my first priority would be the creative materials. That is the most likely indication, in my opinion, of whether the film will be able to gross millions of dollars or little money at all. Some films are great, and others are truly bad. Unlike almost every other public campaign for films, we are making our screenplay available and a 26 min sample. From my experience, everyone associated with a hit film benefits in ways they never imagined. But the risk is indeed real.
Thanks again!"

However, here is a high level breakdown: Due to not being able to keep up with customer demand, we have been out of stock for over 50% of our time in business. Based on our in stock sales numbers, we would have had about $1.2 million in sales if we did not experience the gaps in inventory. Based on those numbers and our projected growth, the tools we used valued our company at $5 million. The $2 per share is a calculation off of the valuation and amount of shares that we are offering.

Elevate Nutrition,https://www.startengine.com/elevate-nutrition,Robin Danielsen,,No,3 months ago,"I think you are being very optimistic with your ""in stock sales numbers"" projection for your sales without gaps in inventory.... What percentage of sales are through Amazon? What was the stockout rate on Amazon? What percentage of sales were through your own site? Stockout percentage here?

If you are organically ranked on amazon when you are in stock and that is what you are basing your potential sale data on, I can understand that a little more. If you are talking about your site, well we also know that stockouts drive demand and cause consumers to buy more when you are back in stock (elevating the sales/stock in day which would lead to wildly exaggerated projections for what you should have done).

What is your customer acquisition strategy? I didn't see this listed anywhere? Ok great, you did a custom formulation, but the same thing stands that anyone can get these products made at one of a plethora of contract manufacturers around the US, so why your products vs all the other similar products already out, or coming out?

Your timeline has you going into major retail stores in 2021, is this included in your 20-23 projections that you are basing your valuation on? How do you plan on getting into these retailers? How do you plan on funding the initial rounds of inventory necessary? What is the strategy for making sure turn rates are high on launch with each retailer?","Hi Robin,

All great questions! Our in-stock sales numbers were based on the trends since we launched our company. Our stockout rate is calculated at 62.96%. Our sales breakdown is 90% Amazon sales and 10% on-site sales. And yes, you are correct, the organic ranking on Amazon does have a large impact on sales trends.

Regarding customer acquisition strategy, we do PPC/SEO on Amazon, retargeting, Facebook and Instagram buys, social, blog posts, email marketing, and we have built a network of brand ambassadors. We are focusing efforts on enticing more customers to purchase off of ElevateNutrition.com (rather than Amazon) by providing discount codes and free 2-day shipping. We would like to grow our onsite sales to be a “larger piece of the pie” so we can use more customer data for retargeting and customer acquisition.

Our company and products are truly unique. We are not a traditional sports supplement company, and we are also not a traditional plant-based/vegan company. We are merging the both worlds and acting as a pioneer in the industry. The reason we created Elevate, is because as competitive athletes, there were no products on the market that met our needs. Most supplement companies used all animal-based materials, and there were no vegan companies that had products that tasted good and had the right macro nutrients. In fact, many of the sports supplements on the market are not available in plant-based alternatives (still to this day). When we first started Elevate, we quickly learned why no other companies were able to meet our needs! Frankly put, it was not easy to formulate plant-based products that meet mainstream fitness needs. There are limitations with sourcing plant-based materials, and overcoming the earthy tastes associated with plants. Also, very few manufactures had experience with creating plant-based/vegan supplements for fitness. Many of them laughed at us! However, after going through a handful of manufacturers, we found a manufacturer that was willing to work with us on custom sourcing plant-based materials and unique formulation… for no upfront costs. This allowed use to spend time formulating the ideal mix of ingredients and sourcing the most quality raw materials. We leveraged our knowledge/experience in nutrition and fitness to come up with our unique formula. We have worked long and hard to source our ingredients and come up with formulas that are effective, macro nutrient friendly, natural, and still taste good. All without the use of animal products, artificial flavors, or fillers. Consumers are getting smarter and becoming more health conscious in their choices. Many are taking notice of the harmful ingredients used in mainstream supplements, and we stand out as a company that can be trusted.

Regarding competition, there is nothing stopping other companies from attempting to “copy us”, however it will just be that…an attempt. And given the work we have put in; we ensure it won’t be easy! However, of course like all industries, there will always be copycats and future competition. We plan to combat this by continuing to grow our loyal customers base. Our customers know what they are getting when taking an Elevate supplement and that is why they keep coming back. We plan to continue to create a loyal following, and in time it won’t matter what other companies attempt to copy us, because we will have gained the trust of our customers.

Regarding our move to retail, our anticipated date is actually 2022 in our projections (thanks for catching that, we will adjust the timeline). We have personal connections with a large US distributer and will tap that resource when the time is right. This will get us into all of the major health food stores. For funding the initial rounds of inventory, we will be doing a future round with a VC firm. Initial talks have already been underway, and a lot of interest has been expressed into working with us. For turn rates, we have not detailed out our retail strategy so this is not a question we can answer at this time.

Thanks, I hope we answered all of your questions!

Elevate Nutrition,https://www.startengine.com/elevate-nutrition,chris lingle,,No,3 months ago,why are you using proprietary blends in your pre-workout? If I'm taking something I want to know that I'm getting an effective dose of the ingredient. from what I see your prop blend is 11g - how do I know I'm getting enough citrulline malate (an effective dose is 6g with a 2:1 ratio) do I get a 6g of BCAA's at a 2:1:1 ratio? if there is only 11g in this blend I'm not getting an effective dose. Is anything your intro said something about products on the market not being effective but how can you claim yours are if I don't know what I'm getting and clearly the serving size isn't big enough?,"Hi Chris! We appreciate the feedback and questions regarding our pre-workout. This product has not yet launched, and the graphics you see are 3D images. Therefore, after reading through your comments, we we are heavily considering your recommendations on listing our our ingredients. However, we would like to explain the reason we went with using our term ""performance blend"" as opposed to individual grams per ingredients is for 2 reasons. We have been working to choose the perfect combination of natural plant-based sources that, combined, produce the desired effects for a pre-workout the market has never seen. Our products differ from standard mainstream fitness and cannot be compared to such products, so we cannot be compared on a gram by gram basis because our sources and approach to our blends are different. The mainstream pre-workouts on the market, that contain 6g of Citrulline Malate, are derived from animal-based sources, and they are using artificial flavors and fillers to both mask the taste and alter the consistency. This is not our approach, as we are focusing on quality materials and leveraging only the finest plant-based natural sources. So while certain aspects of our blend may contain slightly less grams of the mainstream brands, our focus is on quality of the formula and on our customers well being...all while being just as effective as the mainstream supplement brands (without the harmful effects on the body). This particular pre-workout blend, of ours, contains 3gs of Citrulline Malate per serving. Studies show that 2gs of Citrulline Malate, per serving, is needed to achieve the desired effects in improvement of vascular function during workouts. In addition to our product containing enough Citrulline Malate per serving , we have included beet root powder in our performance blend. Beet root powder both enhances the effects of vascular function, and aids in athletic performance, which combined produces very effective results! The 6gs Citrulline Malate study, you are referring to, is based off of a 24 hours period, in which the user is advised to consume 6gs of Citrulline Malate spread out in 4 different doses throughout the day. Since this is not just a Citrulline Malate product, we would advise our users to take a separate Citrulline Malate supplement if they are looking to fully benefit off of Citrulline Malate. We plan on releasing our own line of Citrulline Malate as well, so customers will have the option for smaller doses throughout their day....Regarding your question about us claiming our products are more effective, this was in reference to 2 things 1) referenced above... our products are more effective then animal-based products due to the quality of our plant-based ingredients and natural ingredients used and 2) there are no other plant-based products on the market that are doing it ""right"", and quite like us! None of our plant-based and certified by vegan.org competitors are producing products that contain Citrulline Malate and BCAAs, Beta Alanine, Creatine, etc. We are creating a whole new category of nutritional supplements. And we are confident that our approach is the future of nutritional supplements! We would love for you to be a part of it! Please let me know if you have any other questions about the investment. :)"

In your pitch you mention a few times that ""we're selling so fast, our manufacturers can't keep up"". It's great to see that demand is high, but it's a major risk if you have supply chain problems that can't keep up with demand. How do you intend to address these manufacturing limitations you're seeing and shore up your supply chain?","Hi David, that's a great question! Thank you for your investment, we are excited to have you as a part of our company! To answer your question on the manufacturing...the simple answer is that we will solve the problem by placing larger orders. This will allow us to keep a constant inventory flow while our manufacture is working on the next batch of orders (12-14 week lead time). Also, this round of funding will allow us to place more frequent orders at a cheaper price per unit.

Prime Lightworks,https://www.startengine.com/primelightworks,Manuel E. Lugo Recart,8,No,a month ago,"Hello, in trying to undestand the technology your team offers, I found information about the radio frequency resonant cavity thruster, also called the 'impossible electromagnetic drive'. Please explain and expand on the differences in technological approaches. Thank you.","Hello Manuel, there have been multiple attempts to develop propulsion technology that fall within the category of radio frequency resonant cavity thruster. Groups developing this technology previously include SPR Ltd, Cannae LLC, NASA Eagleworks, and Technische Universität Dresden. The main differences are in the cavity shape and dimensions, and the RF electronics technology and frequency.

For RF electronics, we now use a software defined radio (SDR) instead of a cavity magnetron. We have found that the RF cavity resonant frequency shifts due to vacuum and thermal fluctuations, so we have included a feedback loop to lock our frequency on resonance. (Cavity magnetrons can only operate at a single frequency.) To produce thrust will require this feedback loop to lock our frequency on resonance. Our RF cavity resonance measures return loss of 28dB (-S11), and quality factor of 7e4 (Q-Factor).

As an added benefit, we have increased our radio frequency to X-Band which allows us to decrease the size of our cavity resonator to within 1U CubeSat footprint (10cm * 10cm * 10cm). This will allow us to support both small and large spacecraft. We have also added magnetic shielding to our RF electronics enclosure to eliminate false positive anomalous thrust as reported by Technische Universität Dresden. We presented our test results eliminating false positive anomalous thrust at SmallSat Conference 2019.

In summary, our RF resonant cavity thruster technology is designed for CubeSat form factor, includes a feedback loop to lock our frequency on resonance and maximize thrust, and uses magnetic shielding to eliminate false positive anomalous thrust from interaction with Earth’s magnetic field. Our company is uniquely suited to prove this technology is feasible, as our co-founders combine experience from physics research at Harvard, CERN, and JPL, with RF engineering at SpaceX and Millennium Space Systems."

* Our patent pending covers the Resonator (Thruster) and Enclosure (Power Electronics) as well as the electromagnetic frequency and waveform mode associated with maximizing thrust quality factor.
* Prime Lightworks propulsion is categorized as Electric. The literature often refers to RF resonant cavity thruster propulsion as being solar generated because of what you said. “The dots connect” because solar power is often used to generate energy for satellite electric propulsion.

Prime Lightworks,https://www.startengine.com/primelightworks,Alan Jacobson,30,Yes,a month ago,"Hi, can you say a little about the finances involved here. What will your monthly burn be going forward if you follow your plan? What is the real minimum you need to raise for this project to be viable (and please describe what would change if you only raised that minimum)? Finally, it sounds like you took an idea that has its roots at NASA - how confident are you that your patent will be awarded? Thanks.","Hi Alan, regarding the finances involved here, we plan to keep our monthly burn consistent at $50K per month moving forward. The practical minimum here is to raise $600K so this project will be viable, as that amount will support an additional 12 months of prototype refinement and vacuum testing at our headquarters and with a third-party test facility. (This may be possible at $300K and 6 months runway.) Should we raise up to our maximum, we would have the option to extend our runway to 18 months or to increase our monthly burn to $75K with an accelerated 12 month development schedule.

We are confident our patent pending will be awarded, as the prior art focused on injecting RF from cavity magnetrons without optimizing frequency feedback for resonance. We believe our patent pending is novel, non-obvious, and useful because it combines physical analysis of electromagnetic field equations, to determine RF cavity resonant frequency, with electronics design and operation, to lock onto RF cavity resonant frequency and maximize thrust production."

The only number for your product that I should consider as an investor is the last one, electric propulsion manufacturing TAM of $170, is that correct?","Hi Leonardo, you are correct, the number you should focus on is electric propulsion manufacturing TAM of $170M per year. This TAM is growing at 24% CAGR and is projected to be $630M per year by 2024.

That being said, our electric propulsion system prototype includes nearly all components of a CubeSat, including Li-ion battery storage, flight computer, power management, and software defined radio (SDR). For this reason, we see growth opportunities from electric propulsion manufacturing ($170M TAM), into satellite manufacturing ($15B TAM) and satellite services ($128B TAM) such as RF telecommunication.

In addition, I am having difficulty finding any relevant information on RP-323 since the initial Phase I clinical trial results were published in June 2006. What progress has been made in the past 13 years? I am also in agreement with others here that the funds necessary for a Phase II clinical trial can be enormous.

Theradex is a CRO (Contract Research Organization).

After reading that I was surprised you claimed here that ""Phase I Clinical Trial and safety study has been completed and has established the validity and effectiveness of our drug. We are satisfied that unlike the current treatment options, our drug’s side effects are non-threatening and short-lasting.""

Could you explain how would you justify that optimistic claim after such bad results on the clinical trial?

Thanks!","Dear Mr. Pestana,

Thank you for the opportunity to answer your questions. The various levels of FDA Clinical Trials is a key issue to understand. Phase 1 is to determine the safety of an investigational new drug; determining MTD (maximum tolerated dose); and finally the side effect profile as it relates to severity and reversibility with drug cessation (termination of treatment). Adverse effects were episodic or transient in nature, which is in line with our statement “non-threatening and short lasting.” During dose escalation, treatment continues while dosage increases until dose limiting toxicities are observed then dosing is backed down in order to determine MTD. These dose limiting toxicities would be reported as severe side effects as part of the normal processes. We have PASSED the Phase 1 level successfully, have determined the maximum dose tolerated and safety profile. During the trial the side effects which did occur were reversible when drug treatment was terminated, and the side effects were found to be neither severe nor life threatening.

Phormeds RP-323 is a gene repair therapy. Please explain how it destroys cancer and mutations while repairing cells? You mentioned AML, HODGKINS LYMPHOMA & PARKINSONS. Have you’ve done any trails with other cancers to see how they react to your therapy?
Where can I see your phase 1 clinical trail results?
I had a rare SARCOMA 35 plus years ago. Large growth in inner thigh muscle, removed. They said metastasis in lungs, After conventional treatment I did HOMEOPATHY from an MD treating the disease (not symptoms) using a combination of strict diet, homeopathic medicines, some vitamins, powerlifting, martial arts, changed employment. Using this approach in order to strengthen my immune system, mental outlook. A year later metastatic we’re gone. I think by attacking cancer from all available avenues was why I had success.

Do you feel that being in American Fork will stifle the growth of the business? I know High West was very successful, but Park City is a completely different culture than Happy Valley.

The pitch says about 20% of profits will come from direct to consumer. Do you think there will be repeat traffic, or will the visitors be one-offs and tourists?

There are currently two liquor offerings, do you anticipate having other popular boozes like other craft distilleries such as Leopold Brothers?

Thank you!","Hi Jake, Great questions.

Surprisingly, we have had a tremendously positive reception in happy valley. The city councils of Lehi and Pleasant Grove have both welcomed us with open arms and unanimously approved the zoning, consent, and licensing we sought. We have attended now, nearly a dozen city council meetings with both cities combine, and the only public comment at all has been in support of us.

We were honestly a bit surprised as the perception is that the culture is more conservative, but it is clearly changing or wasn't even that conservative to begin with. We have spoken with the Silicon Slopes organization as well and part of their charter is to make the valley more attractive to the outside tech sector and they see it too.

I expect most of the traffic to be transient or tourism based, but there will certainly be a regular or repeat segment as well.

As far as our product offering. The short answer is; hell, yes! Already we are preparing to have an additional offering using Asian Pears. Our mission is to have our recipe still working almost as hard as the production still. We love to experiment and the list of new things to try and develop is loooong. Leopold has made some incredible spirits and we almost had a deal buying some of their equipment, but opted for some more local pieces.

FII owns the IP and it appears that WaterRR is a sales/consulting spinoff essentially. Just trying to wrap my mind around ""how this could work"" and how a WaterRR common equity holder would benefit. The big picture opportunity is there.","Bruce replies:
David, your question is right on…it crystallizes our challenge. Water Resource Recovery (WRR) has many paths. What we are finding is that “less is more.” In other words, the more self-contained our WRR package is for our clients, the more turnkey, the better they like it. For example, our WRR marketing thrust for 2020 and beyond is likely to focus more on solar power generation than growing landscape trees and plants.

Why? Because it’s more turnkey.

WaterRR makes money by selling revenue-generating water solutions across FII’s territory; by that I mean the parts of the world not yet licensed. Today there are only six licensed BioHaven manufacturers, all with well-defined territories. On the other hand, FII’s unlicensed territory is vast, about 80% of the planet. WaterRR has the unique advantage of being able to function throughout FII’s territory. And in the event our model takes hold, and demand justifies it, WaterRR can also manufacture BioHavens. After all, the key principals of WaterRR are the same folks that manufactured the very first BioHavens. WaterRR is positioned to experience both a manufacturing and distributor margin when selling WRR.

WaterRR is testing whether water really is the next oil. We offer a unique opportunity for progressive water managers to not just address their water quality issues, but to generate new revenue while doing so.

It’s important to note that we do not have sufficient funding to drive a large sales force…currently. We are working on that one. In the meantime, our focus is on key demonstration projects."
WaterRR,https://www.startengine.com/waterrr-inc,David Young,4,No,3 months ago,"What percentage of potential clients already have the human capital and infrastructure to implement the revenue generating option? Realistically, how much ""work"" is required by the client to actually generate a ROI?","Bruce replies: David, great question, and elucidating. WaterRR’s Preliminary Design Report (PDR) budgets for scouting out key vendor connections. In other words, we help clients develop working vendor relationships. This particularly applies to landscape trees and plants, and forage fish. Solar power generation however, is usually most revenue impactful when the client can utilize the generated electricity themselves, and replace retail value grid based electricity. This usually makes more sense than selling such power to a power utility and can frequently work for clients like municipalities."

WaterRR and Floating Island International (FII) are separate corporations. FII is the majority shareholder in WaterRR. WaterRR operates under license to FII in terms of IP. WaterRR is effectively a customer of FII, as projects are manufactured by FII’s licensees and FII receives a royalty on each sale. In territories held by an FII licensee, WaterRR does not operate, unless by agreement with the licensee. In unlicensed territories, it is the client's call as to whether a project is a standard FII project or a water resource recovery project, depending on whether the client wants to generate revenue from the installation."

WaterRR,https://www.startengine.com/waterrr-inc,Edward Sanborn,,No,4 months ago,"There are quite a few issues with algae blooms in the canals and in Lake Okeechobee in Florida.
When water reaches a certain hight in Lake O. they discharge the water into both the eastern and western rivers that make their way out to the Golf of Mexico or into the Atlantic Ocean. When that happens bad things happen to sea life in those areas. In the canals of Florida the algae growth is unhealthy for area residents. I am wondering how your company can help?","Hi Edward, our company can certainly help. One of the main causes of algae blooms is an excess of phosphorus in water, which BioHavens can reduce by promoting biodiversity and enhancing bio-accumulation. They work in lakes and canals - anywhere water can circulate through an island and its plant root biomass. WRR systems make it more cost-effective to treat large water bodies as they promote harvest as a phosphorus-removal strategy, enabling a possible ROI. Fish harvest has been successful in reducing phosphorus in Lake Apopka.

The following cannot be specific, but does represent a general overview of our direction:

1. We are a “long” play. We do not anticipate issuing dividends at any point during the next three years.

2. Our vision is to develop a promising technology, that of floating treatment wetlands. We do believe that our technology will make a substantive difference in terms of greenhouse gas mitigation. We also believe that climate change is the primary challenge associated with human sustainability. And we believe that certain appropriate technologies will profit in this field, ours being one such.

3. Certainly we will consider partnering with companies that bring value with them. To date, we have had initial conversations with several such companies. The concept has merit, and could ultimately result in substantive ROI for investors.

Every time I read this presentation I am more impressed and excited about your technology. I think I'm going to invest, but three follow-ups first. 1. I may not have worded my first question clearly. What I'm really looking for is why now, after so many years, will things be different and the business will now finally take off. For many reasons I hope you are wildly successful, but I hesitate just a little when companies here have been around for a while. 2. What is the cost to a municipality to switch over to you - if most have a system in place is it easy and cheap for them to switch to you? 3. It drives me crazy that companies can do multiple closes here - early investors have the disadvantage of not knowing how much will be raised, and not having the information gained through later news and answers here. That said, I want to invest early to show support and help attract other investments. My question: Let's say you raise only 25K here, what steps will you need to take to be successful? Thanks again - I think I'm in.","Hello again, Alan. I appreciate your seeking more clarity. The reasons we believe we will succeed with WaterRR now are:
* We have a narrow focus on lagoon-based wastewater, which we have experience of and have a standard, scalable solution for; there is a need, there is funding and the sales process, while it can be long, is relatively straightforward. It’s as if we have distilled the last 12 years of FII's research data, market experience and product development to be poised for today.
* Direct sales model as opposed to royalty revenue - FII's revenue has come mainly from licensing and royalties, though two years ago we started making direct sales. WaterRR’s revenue will all come from direct or distributor sales, therefore return a higher margin.
* Water Resource Recovery is undoubtedly the future of wastewater and we are right there, with a simple, easy-to-understand system.

2) The cost for a municipality to switch over to us is the cost of the product and installation. We are targeting communities where the ”system in place” is either a facultative lagoon, which is basically just a lagoon, and aerated lagoons, which means the lagoon can be managed with anything from a few aerators to a sophisticated array. In either case, we are a straightforward retrofit that will supplement what they already have. The actual technology, including the solar thermal innovation, starts at $120,000 and goes up in these increments depending on the scale needed.

3) If we only raise 25K, we will spend that on our best sales efforts, and on testing components of our WRR system. We would then be reliant on sales income to fund our ongoing progress. We do have confidence that we have the resources within the FII network to raise the funding we need.

Alan, I hope this answers your questions! I have enjoyed our exchange and hope to see you on board! If you think of anything else, I’ll be happy to weigh in.

You've been doing this for 14 years, and I read the description of the new business model and such, but I'm still wondering what will really be different now - how will this funding change things in a way that the business could not do so far. How much do you really need to raise to make that change a reality? 2. What are the cost differences involved in using your solution vs. current technologies, and what has been the experience of your current customers as far as the time until that cost is recouped through savings? (As an aside, is there any possible use of your product in ponds and lakes - here in the Northeast so many recreational lakes are endangered by pollutants - could your system be used by a lake association for example to help purify a lake used for recreation?) Thanks!","Hello, Alan,

Thank you for supportive response and insightful questions.
We decided to make WaterRR separate from FII because FII carries out business in all sectors of the water industry, whereas WaterRR is specific to the wastewater sector, at least initially. Being independent of FII enables us to fund our own priorities, such as getting the solar thermal heating system system up and running at a WW lagoon next winter and developing a turnkey harvesting solution.

We are seeking enough funding to enable us to carry on without sales revenue for two years. However, we do already have a promising sales pipeline. Our sweet spot would be $500,000, which would fund us sufficiently to complete the R&D projects in 2019 in two demonstration sites. Additional funding would go to developing our sales and marketing network and expanding our management team. A license agreement with FII gives us access to the FII patents, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as a network of manufacturers and their existing networks, which is a huge benefit to WaterRR.

Ours is one of the only affordable technologies that treats lagoon wastewater while recovering the nutrients and commoditizing them. It’s not always possible to make cost comparisons between related technologies because of other factors, such as freight, installation and maintenance costs the product cost itself, but we know we fit comfortably into our market sector as a treatment solution, even before we realize our WRR value for the community. We project that the community will start to see value in the fourth year of installation, as related to tree growth and harvest.

FII has a long history of successfully using BioHaven Floating Islands in ponds, and even some lakes, such as Levings Lake in Rockford, IL. It’s been a challenge to use them in larger lakes, though, because of the cost relative to funding available. WaterRR will change this. Give us 2 - 3 years to develop and prove the system and we will bring the WRR value proposition to lake associations and municipal lakes.

The TAM for diesel school buses is 480,000 for the entire nation and 24,000 for California. Assuming each bus requires its own charger, which is very common in our use case for charging electric buses, we have a very large addressable market. At this time, we believe the SAM is up to 70% of the TAM. There are less than 300 electric buses currently in California; however, that number is growing rapidly and we expect it to double over the next 12 months."
Liberty Access Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/liberty-plugins-inc,Miguel Costa,3,No,4 months ago,"Hello Mr. Outwater,
I am interested in your company but I have some questions before investing:
- What is the price of the Hydra system? And/or price range for your electric systems?
- On a comment below it was mentioned that Amazon could be a potential client. If, by your offering details, you are a unique player on your approach outside of public electric charging, why hasn't Amazon contacted you yet? If they are being this aggressive surely they need to get something to power all those vans. I am concerned that big companies, because of their financial power, will make their own arrangements to power their electric fleets not caring about where the electricity comes from and security level of the system.

As it was mentioned before, the evaluation is quite steep... more than 19x current revenue... Are there any big projects, letters of intent/interest by major distribution players?


Best regards,
Miguel Costa","Miguel, sorry for the delay. We are starting our “end of the year” push to ship product. Thank you for your interest and I will attempt to answer your good questions while you are considering investing in Liberty. The price of the Hydra system that is used for controlling and managing normal EV charging starts at approximately $5,000 and depends on how many chargers are under control. The Hydra model used for charging school buses and light to medium trucks and van fleets costs an additional $1,000. This is what we call AC Fast Charging. Most important is that taken together with the chargers our system costs about 40% less than fully networked smart chargers and we offer essentially the same features. I do not want to comment specifically about Amazon because it would be too speculative at this time. But yes, they need to be considering how they will charge all of their new electric delivery vehicles. I believe that large companies like Amazon that have already chosen to go electric will also be sensitive to the source of the electricity and understand that people will be watching. As for valuation and the future projects, we are growing rapidly along with the general EV charging industry. A fact to consider: we have now received orders to cover charging for approx 50 e-school buses. There are 18,000 diesel buses in Calif alone. This electrification process is just beginning. We will soon be announcing some projects on this platform that I believe will help support our current valuation. Thank you again for your comment and questions."

How will you handle a good service response time with warranty quick repair for these locations?,"Charles, yes, we agree that a quick response time for broken equipment, especially if under warranty, is essential for the brand and reputation. Of course, there are some customers where we do not have local repair reps. In those cases, we usually make an agreement with the local contractor who installed our equipment for the site owner. We have done this in multiple locations across the nation and this has allowed us to offer rapid response in the unlikely event of equipment failure.

Microbials are going to be a tough one for field testing. There is a possibility we will be able to test for certain mold/fungal toxins but not mold itself. Certain residual solvent could be detected with additional development, depending on the minimum threshold required. Pesticides are definitely part of our future plans with our technology. We aim to enable the detection of at least one pesticide that is not permitted for use in cannabis products. Regarding the DEA hemp regulation, our goal is to provide hemp growers a tool to monitor their crops before (!) they send it out for compliance testing in approved labs. Today, hemp farmers are forced to harvest weeks before the plants achieve maximum yield and (CBD) potential because of the concern of exceeding the 0.3% THC(A) threshold. Our device would enable them to monitor the plants and make sure that they don't exceed their limit while enabling maximum yield and (CBD) potency, thereby maximizing their profit (CBD potential is linked to the final price of their harvest)."

Secondly, based on the information here the cost of the test is $15 each. The competition costs are zero per test.
That being said, it does appear to be a sound idea simply not breakout tech and cost prohibitive to some. How are you planning on marketing to grab a piece of the action?","Dear Matthew,

Thank you for your constructive criticism. I would like to argue your points: we do acknowledge there are other portable devices out there. Sage is just one of them that offers that. However, your claim that it is zero per test is a bit misleading given the high initial cost of the device that can range in several thousands. What we want to bring to the market is a system that is accessible to anyone, from growers to producers. Regarding the nondestructive sampling i also see a technical issue with that given the intra-plant variability of cannabinoid content. And when you are dealing with multiple pounds of materials, ‘destructing’ 0.2 or even 1gram is irrelevant. There are definitely other players in the market however we believe we have found the right formula that combines low cost, high accuracy and ease of use. Regarding marketing we’ll take the traditional routes and rely on referrals.

Again I just would like to understand the value, because is interesting but I don't see the value for a house like my house, fully controlled by Amazon echo, so I don't see how can you guys be successful","Hi Javier – 

It's a great question and we're happy to clarify. But, to be completely honest, we might not be a great fit for your smart home. We would love to have you in the Atmos Family, but some people don't really need AtmosControl. At least not yet.

A couple years ago, I designed and built AtmosControl to solve a problem with my smart home – connecting and controlling devices that use different protocols (i.e. Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave). It sounds like you're perfectly happy with Alexa, which means your devices are probably Wifi and Bluetooth.

The other 2 (we call them Z&Z) are popular connection protocols for smart home devices, but are lesser known. That will change though, since Zigbee is part of the new CHIP standard, with Amazon, Apple, and Google, so those devices will become more common and well known. And we added Infrared to the other 4, since a lot of devices still use it (fans, TVs, garage doors, etc).

Another trend we're seeing is with dealers/builders/installers. Zigbee and Z-Wave have been popular with them for years and that popularity (and usage) continues to grow.

Here are some more stories on CHIP...

Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Bruce Wertz,12,No,a month ago,"Hi, Mark. I'm in the process of completing my due diligence on AtmosHome, and so far I'm leaning heavily in favor of investing. Many of the questions already asked have been most helpful, as have some of the third-party info written by CDNet, Z/Net and others. One of my concerns is there has been little space devoted to the completion of delivering the pre-orders that were received with an anticipated delivery date of Q2/Q3 of 2019. As a result, I have a few questions.
1. How many pre-orders did you receive and what percent of those pre-ordered systems have been delivered as of 12/31/19?
2. If not yet completed, when do you feel, with 100% certainty, the balance of the pre-orders will be delivered?
3. You indicate the funds received from this round of funding will be used mostly for R&D. If that's the case, is a line item in the budget in place specifically for this purpose, or will the funds go into the General Fund where it can be spent anywhere deemed necessary?
4. If the latter is the case, will any of these funds be used to complete the yet to be delivered pre-orders, and if so, what percentage do you feel will be allocated for this purpose.
I look forward, with great interest to your responses and to potentially becoming part of Atmos Home family of investors.
Thank you.","Hi Bruce – 

We started beta in September with 5 hubs in batch #1. We are now working on batch #5, with a total of 8 batches scheduled. Almost half of the 100 units we allocated for beta are out in the field. So, just over 8% of our 1200 units sold have been allocated and almost 50% are in use by beta testers now.

While we aren't able to give specific shipping dates yet, due to the SEC's position on forward-looking statements, however, we will begin shipping production hubs once our beta testing is complete. That said, we turned a proverbial corner in December, with the bugs becoming more specific and easier to replicate in the lab.

This means we are able to turn around a new build and push an update with bug fixes more quickly, so we are (slightly) accelerating our shipping schedule for the remaining ~50 beta hubs. It also means we were able allocate additional development resources towards integrating smart home devices into our production environment, test them internally, and then push them live (over the air) to the hubs in the field.

For a high level breakdown on the use of proceeds, we've put together details that start on page 19 in our Form C, under Terms. As a summary, proceeds will go into General Funds, to be funneled where they're needed, which are predominantly in the areas of R&D (specifically, software development), Marketing, and Operations (35%, 24%, and 20%, respectively).

Happy new year to you, too!

We conducted our pre-sales at $299 USD to build some early interest, but once we’re out of beta and shipping production-level hubs, we’ll be in the range of $329-349 USD.

At this point, we expect our margins to be 45%, but as we scale with volume, we can drive our COGS down and plan to improve our margins to 65%. We’re predicting we’ll hit that mark within 2 years.

We do not charge a subscription fee for AtmosControl, because it doesn’t require any ongoing data storage, sensor monitoring, etc. However, we are exploring other smart home products that could/would necessitate a subscription fee, but don’t have any concrete plans, or a timeline that we can share just yet."

Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Richard Antwi,10,Yes,2 months ago,"This is more of a question than comments. I am interested in investing but I have a few questions with regards to the deal offered. Please, correct me if I'm wrong. If this offering type is a Convertible Note that converts into stocks with a 20.0% discount on 12 million valuation cap, explain to me why maturity date is 10/10/2021 and annual interest rate 5.0 for? What is the difference between this you're offering and Crowd SAFE? Say I invest $500 in your company will I be holding company stocks in the future if it's bought out or IPO? Please excuse my questions is just that I need to know before investing","Hi Richard. Thanks for the question and we're happy to clarify the details.

As you know, a convertible note is debt, while a CrowdSAFE is a convertible security that is not debt. As a result, a convertible note includes an interest rate and maturity rate, while a CrowdSAFE does not. Both CrowdSAFEs and convertible notes convert into equity in a future-priced equity round and 2 years is a common/typical maturity date for convertible notes.

So, using your example of a $500 investment and Series A investment round that we close at 1 year from the time of your investment, that $500 investment, plus 5% interest (totaling $525), would convert into equity, based on the valuation assigned to the company at that time.

If the new Series A investors are investing at a company valuation of $15M or greater (the sum of this note's valuation cap, plus 20% of $15M), then your shares would convert at a maximum valuation of $12M.

This would give you a conversion valuation that is (at a minimum) 20% more favorable than the new investors. And if the new valuation is less than $15M, you will still receive a 20% discount to the new investment valuation for your conversion."

Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Kory Roth,,Yes,3 months ago,"Mark,

I am actually a Diamond Level Control4 Pinnacle dealer, and see the value in your product... however some of your statements above regarding the 'competition system price' are very misleading. A basic C4 system (essentially a hub), while indeed required to be installed by a qualified dealer, can be had for about 10% of your quoted pricing, installed, incorporating near all control disciplines as AtmosControl. I invested in your product back on April 3rd, 2019, and have yet to see anything come of it. I DO THINK there is a valid place for your product, especially for the DIY community. It is a complex and ever-changing business position, and I believe you have begun to see the complexities in 'working with' many DIY cloud based products, and long-standing inter-company relationships (ie: Sonos+Crestron vs everybody else) and the challenges faced in creating communication between these platforms and proprietary implementations of communication protocols per product.

So, being an investor back in April, with no product yet in-hand to start my 'burn-in' process to evaluate your platform, can there be assurance my previous investment, including an additional one, will truly be met with beta testing product? I'm excited to see how your platform evolves.

Additionally, I have interest in your platform as a current automation design and installation dealer.

Thank you - Kory R.","First and foremost, we really appreciate you believing in us, Kory.

Thanks to early supporters like you, we were able to get a lot of traction and take some big steps this year. You should be receiving the email newsletter we send customers, with updates and progress reports. If you aren't, please email contact@atmoshome.com and we’ll fix that, then forward the latest one to you.

Unfortunately, you're absolutely right about our delay in bringing AtmosControl to market. I was overly optimistic on the timing and underestimated the complexities around getting all of these smart home devices and protocols to work nicely with our new hardware and software platform.

Recently, we solved the hardware issues and have a physical device that's solid. We're extremely proud of how it looks and how it performs. Now, we're squashing bugs as fast as we possibly can, adding features and integrating device APIs into our production software.

We're going to keep putting in long days and paying attention to the tiniest of details, so we can get into production and start shipping as soon as possible. When we're happy with it, we're confident you will be, too.

Control4 did a great job building this smart home automation sector and focusing on high-end installations. Almost 50% of them (46%, to be exact) are over $10K, with 13% over $25K. And on an earnings call, their CEO said small installations still end up at $3K, or more. So, even with their new $300/$500 devices, we see a great opportunity for Atmos Home.

As people add more devices to their smart home, they realize the need for a hub and many of them aren't looking to buy through dealers. These DIY'ers do their own research, pick their own devices, and then buy direct-to-consumer (online, or in retail). This long tail is where Atmos Home fits and it's the space we want to own.

That said, the existing network of dealers and installers represent a significant opportunity. We've talked with dozens who say a considerable chunk of their business is installing off-the-shelf devices, like Ring. Their customers want help setting things up and getting started, but don't want to spend $3K.

Our dealer/reseller program will allow them to do installations with smaller budgets and still make money. Today, we have 150+ registered to sell and install Atmos Home products internationally. We've added you to the list and will reach out next year, when it's ready to roll.

Thanks again for being an early supporter, Kory. We sincerely apologize for the delay, but we're resolved, we're proud of our progress, and we're just getting started.

Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Ross H,,No,3 months ago,"Hi Mark,

I have a few questions that weren't detailed in your online deck. I think you have a very interesting product that I can't wait to get my hands on, but one that also begs a lot of questions since execution will be everything.

1. How do you plan to deploy the capital raised in this round?
2. Do you have more financial info you can share? Balance sheet and P&L?
3. When do you expect to go to market? I've been noticing the delay in launch has been giving Brilliant increased market share. I've been seeing these in a lot of places.
4. What is your exit strategy?
5. You mention taking on companies like Creston/Control4, but I'm unsure how Atmos will handle access control or an interface to control home theaters systems. This centralized system is what makes those systems attractive since you can interact with all systems and there isn't one partner for gate access.
6. What is AtmosSwitch? You briefly hint at a new product.

Thank and looking forward to hearing from you,
Ross","Hi Ross, thank you for the kudos and for your interest. I’ve addressed your questions below.

1. How do you plan to deploy the capital raised in this round?
This round will be used primarily to grow the R&D engineering team, specifically for software development.

2. Do you have more financial info you can share?
Yes, if you click Offering Details in the Terms section, you will find our financial documents. Starting on page 24, you'll see independent, CPA-reviewed financials, with Balance Sheet, P&L (Statement of Operations), Statement of Stockholders’ Equity, Statement of Cash Flows, and Notes to the Financial Statements.

3. When do you expect to go to market?
We are currently producing (and shipping) beta hubs to our earliest supporters and customers, with almost half of them in the field now. While we aren't able to give specific shipping dates yet, due to the SEC's position on forward-looking statements, we will begin shipping production hubs once our beta testing is complete.

Regarding Brilliant, we think they did a nice job building a smarter switch. A number of their engineers and execs spent time at our booth at CES. They have some really smart people on their team and we had a great time talking with them. We just happen to think AtmosControl is a better mousetrap for simplifying your smart home.

By combining voice, touch, smartphone, and gesture controls with all 5 of the most common smart home connections (WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Infrared), AtmosControl is a complete smart home hub. They only include WiFi and Bluetooth, for about the same price.

And since it's replacing a light switch, people have to lean over to interact with it, because it's installed at waist level, not eye level. That said, we have designed AtmosSwitch, as a complementary product to our AtmosControl hub. More on that below.

4. What is your exit strategy?
To be clear, this is not on our radar. We've gotten some early interest, but we're still having fun and completely focused on building a great company, with products that are superior to anything on the market, much like Apple does.

That said, the most likely outcome will be an M&A event. My previous company was acquired and Dean has been on both sides of the process, so it’s a road we're familiar with.

To give more support for this outcome, the smart home sector has seen a bit of activity here – Nest was acquired by Google for $3.2B, Control4 was acquired by SnapAV for $680M, Ring was acquired by Amazon for $1B, and Simplisafe was acquired by Hellman & Friedman for $1B.

On top of that, McKinsey & Co reported that nearly 50% of households with multiple smart devices are looking for a hub, so we think we're in the fortunate position of timing the market pretty well.

5. You mention taking on companies like Creston/Control4...
Our strategy doesn’t have us taking on Crestron/Control4 directly, but rather, owning the huge market segments that they don’t go after. Crestron has said they're 80% focused on commercial/enterprise markets, while Control4's CEO has said, ""What we're not is a $300 DIY solution."" We're filling those gaps.

Ten years ago, home automation was a luxury that only a handful of consumers could afford. We think both companies have done a great job addressing the high-end segment of the market. And their products are specifically geared towards that customer base.

But today, with off-the-shelf smart home devices being widely adopted and the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a new market is available for us to address and own – complete smart home control for the average consumer, with their own devices.

As far as the home theater applications go, we have a remote control on our product/feature roadmap, which will allow us to address this use case in the future. And we'll integrate gate access partners, as well as any others, as our customers request them.

6. What is AtmosSwitch?
AtmosSwitch is the next SKU on our product roadmap. It will be an intelligent lighting controller that replaces your existing light switches, converting any non-smart lights/bulbs on that circuit to smart lighting.

It will fit into (and over) an existing, electrical gang box and will have a touchscreen, giving you control of not just the lights, but all of your Atmos-connected devices.

AtmosSwitch will expand AtmosControl's features throughout your home without having to purchase additional hubs. Think of it like a symbiotic network that lets you simplify your smart home even further, at a price point that's approachable for the average consumer."
Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Nathaniel Worth,,Yes,3 months ago,"Hi Mark!

What’s the targeted production shipment dates?","Apologies for the delay, Nathaniel. With the SEC being particular about any forward-looking statements, we needed to clarify what we could and couldn't say.

We are currently producing (and shipping) hubs to our beta testers and almost half of them are in the hands of our earliest supporters and customers, right now.

While we aren't able to give any specific shipping dates, we will begin shipping production devices once our beta testing phase has been completed."
Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Brent Coulthart,2,Yes,3 months ago,"Hi Mark,
I also wanted to know what makes your product different from the google home hub?","Hi Brent,
Digital assistants like Alexa and Google only have Wifi and Bluetooth, so they can't control devices with Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Infrared protocols, which are used by August, GE, Bosch, Honeywell, Logitech, Kwikset, Iris/Arcus, D-Link, ceiling fans, window treatments, etc.

You could buy a hub for the other protocols, but then you're telling Alexa/Google to use the Z-Wave hub to tell a device to perform an action. And you have to remember which devices are controlled by what/who. It’s a lot to remember and keep straight.

Instead, you could get AtmosControl and be done. Think of it like a universal remote control for all of your smart home devices, even if they’re from a variety of manufacturers and use different protocols. You can see a product comparison matrix on our website here: https://atmoshome.com/product.html"
Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Brent Coulthart,2,Yes,3 months ago,"Hi Mark,
I seen in the other comments you state that your plan is to sell for $329.00. What is the cost to manufacture and where will you be selling it once it hits market? Amazon, walmart, home improvement store ext. Also, do you plan on keeping manufacturing in the united states or move it over sea ever? Lastly what are your plans for the investment your collecting from this round?","Hi Brent, thank you for your question and for your interest in Atmos Home. We have to be somewhat careful when it comes to “forward-looking statements” due to securities laws so I’m going to do a little bit of copy/pasting here from the “The Business Model” section of the campaign page: “When we begin manufacturing, we expect our gross margins to be approximately 45% and ramping to 65% over the next 2 years.”

This would mean that if we were to begin manufacturing today, our cost to manufacture 1 unit would be about $181. We expect that number to come down to around $115 over the next 2 years based on plans for design iterations as well as the economies of scale that come with manufacturing in higher volumes.

Initially, we’ll be selling directly to the consumer via our website, as we have to date. We’ll expand to online distributors such as Amazon and Newegg shortly thereafter. As volume and demand increase, we’ll explore big-box retailers who have a focus in the smart home market such as Best Buy and Target.

As for manufacturing, we would like to keep it in the US for as long as possible, and potentially permanently. We were able achieve this goal in my last business, manufacturing 20K devices per week in the US at the time we were acquired. This past experience and expertise is why we believe that this goal can still be achieved, and why we are uniquely qualified to accomplish it. This combined with rapidly rising labor rates in the areas of the world where consumer electronics devices are typically manufactured as well as the current 30% tariffs on Chinese manufactured consumer electronics is why that we feel that now is a good time to be building these devices here. That said, we will continually evaluate our options and do what is in the best interests of the company and our investors.

This round of investment will primarily be utilized for R&D purposes – growing our development team so the we can rapidly complete our beta testing and software development phase, and launch into production."

Basically if I was to invest 10k could I integrate with Insteon now?","Hi Alex, thank you for your question, as well as your previous investment – it is greatly appreciated. Our plan for Insteon is a multi-pronged approach. At the present moment, we have integrated Insteon via the ISY hub in combination with a PLM module – this works today. We are also an Insteon authorized partner/developer, and we will be supporting the Insteon Hub via their API, although this software integration is not complete just yet. The long term plan is to develop our own PLM that will communicate wirelessly with AtmosControl, and then wireline to any Insteon devices.

If this technology becomes applicable to smart home device communications in the future, we would certainly evaluate its addition to our products. Until then, we feel that the Zigbee and Z-Wave protocols are extremely effective due to their mesh topology, very low power consumption, and they have already achieved widespread adoption."

Atmos Home,https://www.startengine.com/atmos-home,Jon Turbeville,17,Yes,3 months ago,"Are there any products Atmos is currently unable to connect to via any of the methods described?

One would think that Alexa, Google Assistant (or Apple if they catch up), etc, are working towards this same type of solution to be a one stop solution for all things, although I am not aware of it to date. Are you aware them moving towards this direction? If so, what advantage would Atmos have compared to these big balance sheet companies?

If the current more expensive options were to decide to target the users, do you know how easy it would be for their system to be modified for end user control?","Hi Jon, thank you for the question. Currently the AtmosControl can connect to almost all smart home devices either via Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth, or Infrared protocols (these are local connections from AtmosControl directly to the device being controlled), or via Wi-Fi by interacting with the end device manufacturer’s Application Programming Interface (API) which is usually in the cloud. Most device makers provide access to their cloud-based API, as most of these companies now recognize that it is in their best interests to provide compatibility with other devices that could potentially enhance the user experience. There are a few outliers who have chosen the “walled garden” approach and not opened up their API’s (Arlo cameras are one example). These scenarios seem to be getting fewer and further between, however.

We are not currently aware of anything in-the-works at any of the big players that would encroach on this market. Google and Amazon specifically seem to prefer buying vs. building when it comes to these types of markets as evidenced by the Nest (https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-3-2-billion-purchase-of-nest/) and Ring (https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-acquires-ring-maker-of-video-doorbells-1519768639) acquisitions. We view our competitive advantage much as Nest did early on. While being the first mover in the space is important, which we are, we intend to maintain a lead over any competition through elegant design, an intuitive user experience, and new product iterations. We aim to become the Apple of complete home control.

For the more expensive options you refer to (Control4, Crestron, etc.), Control4 in particular has expressed their disinterest in addressing the mass DIY market (https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/control4-not-worried-about-do-it-yourself-smart-home-gadgets/) as it would represent a complete overhaul to their deeply ingrained business model (https://www.cepro.com/news/why_control4_bought_neeo_eol_clarity_diy_remote/)."

But the description of it is really vague, and I would like to see more details to be convinced. What PV efficiency can your product achieve? From the company website, it looks like the manufacturing process is going to involve coating an ink via roll-to-roll process. I wonder if this is indeed cheap, not to mention consistency challenges in such processes. Is there any plan to scale up manufacturing in cheaper locations? Since this is new PV technology, is there sufficient testing time to say what will be the reliability issues (e.g. light soak degradation)? Also, is the wrap-around claim based on theory or is it already demonstrated? Solyndra used to pursue the 'curve' feature and it just turned out to be a huge technical hassle that wasn't worth it (Solyndra doesn't exist anymore).","PI Energy’s technology is still in development. The proprietary technologies details and processes include trade secrets and confidential know-how that we have not provided in the public domain for strategic reasons. However our planned fabrication process for our commercial product includes similar steps to existing high-volume manufacturing processes that exist in mature industries. We expect the initial performance will meet unmet commercial market needs and will target those markets first. We plan to continue improving our materials’ performance after the initial commercial PV product launch to expand our addressable markets.
We expect to have the same long-term reliability and durability of crystalline-silicon PV.
Solyndra’s technology used pre-existing CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) cells arranged in a cylindrical panels, which is quite different from either traditional thin-film PV in the market.
PI Energy’s internal analysis suggests that a PV technology that can address the unmet global potential needs to be: 1.) durable, 2.) provide good performance, 3.) reliable, 4.) non-toxic, 5.) made of earth abundant materials, 6.) lightweight, and 7.) ultra-flexible. According to MIT (report referenced in the materials), neither CIGS or CdTe meet the #4, #5 or #7 requirements. The dominant crystalline-silicon technology in the market today cannot meet the #6 and #7 requirements.

• Progress of the PI Energy technology over the past few years;
• Competitive advantages of the current $48 billion/year solar panel market;
• Assessment of intellectual property position, including three issued patents, pending patents, trade secrets and proprietary know-how;
• Domestic and international partnership and distribution discussions;

PI Energy has developed a solar PV technology that has the potential not only to capture a good portion of the current $48 billion/year solar module market, but we project that it will grow the PV market significantly. There are other disruptive innovation energy companies, that we estimate have higher development and commercialization risks, like those pursuing nuclear fusion reactor development (e.g., General Fusion and TAE Technologies), which have garnered high valuations.

MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,James Orr,11,Yes,2 days ago,"Hi Allan,

Congrats on MSBA being accepted in the 2020 Air Force Accelerator Program. I am not an engineer by any means, but after researching this Program, it’s definitely a huge milestone and accomplishment for the Company. After watching the demo videos of GURU on YouTube, listening to your confidence in GURU in podcasts, and the Company’s acceptance into the Airforce Accelerator program, I decided to invest in MSBAI a few times through this funding campaign.

Correct me if I’m wrong but I read that operational expenses for MSBAI was under $40k in 2018 and if the full $107k is raised, the company can survive for 2yrs (pretty impressive). My questions are:
1. How have you guys kept operational expenses so low?
2. Are you and your team dedicated full time to MSBAI or is this a side project?
3. If this can be answered, how much money have the founding team invested in MSBAI? I’m just curious if you guys also got some skin in the game (beyond money, I believe you and your team’s time and effort is priceless).",Answered above^ thanks!
MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Joseph Harrison,16,Yes,3 days ago,Congratulations with winning the Air Force Accelerator Investment Opportunity! It is surprising that you got it cause I thought they mainly help you get to the prototype stage and you guys are way past that. But congrats anyway. I can’t see how you couldn’t grab a bunch of defense contracts with your invention! Sounds exciting !,"You're correct Joseph that we are indeed past the prototype stage. In fact, the accelerator is in general for companies that are at the stage we are.
As discussed in this article: https://www.airforcemag.com/ten-startups-chosen-for-2020-usaf-tech-accelerator/
“The program launched with the goal of connecting the Air Force to early stage commercially oriented startups with innovative technologies, and adapting Air Force business processes to match the commercial world—instead of turning startups into full-fledged defense contractors,” ...
Twenty companies have worked with the accelerator so far, and all but one have later received Small Business Innovation Research contracts through AFWERX and AFRL. Those awards total more than $20 million"
MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Samuel Azair Azair,8,No,14 days ago,Do you have any patents? Who is currently your biggest competitor?,"Very important questions Samuel: Our assessment is that - particularly with the 'Alice' rules pertaining to software patent, a small company cannot afford to spend a large percentage of their funding (and time) on pursuing patents. Furthermore, the amount of time and funding expended to pursue a claim is practically infeasible for a small company to afford, particularly against a larger company or foreign government. We have therefore decided to protect our technology as a trade secret, by not disclosing key IP and making sure anyone who works on it is under strict contract (along with technological solutions we use to restrict access to core technology).

On your other question: While there are no competitors going after what we are doing, we can name two that are adjacent to what we're doing (listed below). The current business focus of companies in the cloud computing space and engineering software space cater to expert users, and don't have compelling solutions to make it possible for non-experts and small companies to become regular customers and productive users. We are filling a very large need that has existed for quite a long time, which will become even greater as the cloud business continues to explode, as 'exascale' compute becomes available to industry, and a commercial release of quantum computers will make GURU a necessity. The reason is that the human workload becomes the bottleneck preventing a person from being able to harness so much computing power.

We talked about competition in the areas of AI solutions that augment engineers: The aggressive schedule of deployment and Series A projections are in line with other recent activity of companies such as Bonsai (4 year old startup acquired by Microsoft after $13.6 million Series A), and Engineer.ai ($29.5 million Series A). These companies are both developing AI solutions for industrial and engineering applications. The two are pursuing different verticals than MSBAI, but we believe they are close enough for to provide relevant indication of potential. A fundamental difference is that they are building tools for engineers to develop their own internal AI capabilities, whereas GURU is developed by MSBAI to capture the large percentage of companies who don't have the time or resources to do that, and need a reliable end-to-end assistant they can start using for their work.
(these are two examples of companies that assume their end user will get trained up and become experts in their software. In contrast, we are focused on the vast majority of the available market who won't do that)

Joseph asked a question about competition relevant to yours, so I wanted to also point to the answer I gave to that one:
we have a different take on solving problems the ‘big boys’ should have already solved but haven’t. The manner in which we are delivering the service is new, the way we are orchestrating the payments is new, our focus on maximizing ease-of-use is new, and the way we are replicating the capabilities to do it on the computer is new. Another ingredient they surely don’t have is our extreme determination — we’ve seen the future and we know that everything in High Performance Computing is about to change, almost nobody uses HPC compared to the numbers that will, and we have positioned MSBAI to lead the way. The big boys have a stake in the manner they’ve already been doing things and they tend to have too much internal inertia to attempt radical change (which is why startups exist.)

We’ve lived the problems we’re solving, we’ve worked on aggressive engineering projects that forced us to come up with the new strategies, and we’ve been lucky to have access to some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers to test those strategies. We’re confident that our technology is not readily duplicated, and that our moat will grow as we deploy increasing numbers of GURU capabilities — to a point where, rather than devoting their resources and staff to reproducing it, the big boys will find it more cost effective to invest in us or try to acquire us."
MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Samuel Azair Azair,8,No,14 days ago,Why is the maximum for this round 107k and not not more? What kind of runway will that give you? How do you plan to use the money raised in this round?,"Thanks for your interest Samuel! The costs associated with a raise limited to 107k are lower, and it's customary for a lot of companies on this platform. StartEngine says more about this on the site.

MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Joseph Harrison,16,Yes,a month ago,"Hi Mr. Grosvenor,
It is great seeing the progress you are making regarding the GURU technology and its growing implementation. I was just wondering if you ever ""worry"" about the ""big boy"" companies creating a similar or same technology and employ it on a much larger scale, flooding the engineering tech landscape with their products and leaving your company in the rear view mirror since they have the economics to go big much quicker with their abundant resources and personnel. You stated that you are mostly aimed at small to medium sized businesses whereas they can do small, medium and large industries. I want to make another investment but have been hesitant. In my area, Home Depot moved in and a lot of the mom and pop hardware stores went out of business because they could not compete with the lower prices, resources, marketing and established reputation of the larger company (i.e., Home Depot). What can you possibly do to help assure (not guarantee) that can't or won't happen to your company? Also, not to be negative but why is it taking so long to reach 100, 000 in investment crowdfunding since this is a great transforming technology? Do your colleagues not see this or believe this? the general public? I am glad I invested in GURU and the aforementioned questions have swirled in my head a bit and I thought I would just take the risk and ask. I look forward to your answers. Thank You.","Thanks for your post Joseph!

Your first question has previously been asked of Woz & Jobs (how could you possibly compete with IBM?), Page & Brin (how could you possibly compete with Yahoo or Excite?), and so many others.

Like those transformational startups, we have a different take on solving problems the ‘big boys’ should have already solved but haven’t. The manner in which we are delivering the service is new, the way we are orchestrating the payments is new, our focus on maximizing ease-of-use is new, and the way we are replicating the capabilities to do it on the computer is new. Another ingredient they surely don’t have is our extreme determination — we’ve seen the future and we know that everything in High Performance Computing is about to change, almost nobody uses HPC compared to the numbers that will, and we have positioned MSBAI to lead the way.

Great product. Glad I invested. In review of your information releases, I don’t see any correspondence regarding any potential ROI to the investor. I know you can’t give any specific numbers but am considering additional investment but if you could give some type of scenario of profitability and what that means to me the investor , I would appreciate it. If you can’t , I still think GURU is a great idea!","Hi Joseph,
Thanks for your important question. In the Future Projections section of our campaign we discussed specific revenue projections, and the exits of other representative companies which really define the ROI to the investor. We named the key factors “to pursue a projected ARR.” Whether we exit with a later series of investment, or an acquisition, or other exit opportunities, the investor ROI is connected to our ability to achieve this growth, and so far we have been hitting our milestones on this roadmap. If you take the current company valuation we report, and the projected ARR, you can estimate your expected multiple. Using exits of other companies with these kinds of multiples can provide you with additional insight into the investor ROI.

For 2019 we talked about the key factors being initial customer deployments, initial channel partner agreements, and scaling up our ability to build and train new agents (to add capabilities to the platform). We are on track with each of these: we have been aggressively building out the platform (e.g., see the Oak Ridge update), we have first customers (e.g., see the Masten update), we have been aggressively pursuing business development, and we have agreements with first channel partner vendors as well. We’ve publicly announced the ones we’re able to already and we expect to have additional announcements coming. Also see the following section of our website:

MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Joseph Harrison,16,Yes,4 months ago,"Hi Mr. Grosvenor,
I just read an article about Google's Quantum Computer system that can possibly be operationalized within the next three years. It is supposed to be so powerful in its computational and analytical abilities that it blows away any supercomputer now in existence or in existence in the near future. Would Guru be an outdated form of computer interface and problem solving if or when the next generation of computers (Quantum Computers) debut supposedly within the next few years? Does your firm have people trained in Quantum computeration? I am a complete novice in this field and it just seemed related somehow to what Guru is seeking to impact in terms of innovative computer technologies. I look forward to your answers.","Hi Joseph,
Thanks for your question. As computing power increases, the need for a cognitive AI assistant to minimize the human workload to make use of that computing power increases as well. In other words, if the promise of quantum computing, and 'even' the promise of exascale computing, are realized GURU will be needed 'even more' - in fact, having an intelligent manager of this computing becomes absolutely necessary because there is a point where the amount of work needed by the human to setup, run, synthesize results, etc. becomes so high that it's impossible to use all the computing power. We have indeed designed GURU knowing what the future of computing likely looks like (influenced for instance by our work at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing facility - I happen to be returning from the Department of Energy's AI town hall this week where we were talking about and planning for exactly this scenario)
Also, please note that there are differences in opinion about what has been accomplished so far:

MSBAI,https://www.startengine.com/msbai,Gary Moyer,6,Yes,5 months ago,"To Allan Grosvenor, I'm a non-tech marketing person but I'm really impressed with your ideas. Are you considering partnering or providing GURU to key engineering schools to 1) expose your support process to future inventor engineers, 2) gain additional insights from these users to further fine tune GURU (not that I think that's necessary, just a practical byproduct of fresh eyes usage), and 3) expose GURU to more target SME's you mention above. GURU is exciting. I assume your application can be adapted by other disciplines like health care or biotechnology (not to get ahead of ourselves). I thought the ITIF report was eye opening from my stand point. Very educational article. I'll be an investor. GOOD LUCK!

Gary","Our commercial go to market strategy involves a few phases, we agree that partnering with schools is important and we have been in discussions with a first group of schools across the country and internationally. You're right that 1) we certainly do want to get young students and new engineers involved, 2) we in fact chose to architect the system so that we are able to constantly update and refine our agent generation process and that this core technology as well as user interface will be iteratively improved based on our interaction with the users, 3) and yes we are engaged already with a number of SME's and have a strategy to scale up these customers.
Regarding 'other disciplines' - or what we call 'adjacent markets' I mentioned above that our go to market follows a few phases: right now we are in the first phase of preparing the commercial release for first customers that we will work closely with (we adopted the Paul Graham 'Do Things that Don't Scale' strategy). We recently discussed in the updates our 'tooling' we've been developing to build and train our hybrid learning agents and these platform developments are crucial to our ability to scale up the number of capabilities the assistant has. We focus on engineering, and first beach head markets like aerospace and energy. Advances in the tooling, built on top of the architecture choices we made to ensure GURU is highly scalable enables us to grow into adjacent markets, and you're right that we will grow into more disciplines. You're right that the recent ITIF report makes it crystal clear how much of a void we are filling. Thanks for joining us as an investor Gary!"
Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Scott Tobia,4,No,10 days ago,"Honestly Rich it must be disappointing to have been here over a year raising money, dodging questions, pilfering funds you have raised and watching other real companies with real valuations raising 100's of thousands of dollars.

These BS claims you keep making (Big news soon, looking at retail spaces etc) for the last year has played out. Your lies about a shareholder base to go public is just that. It takes 36 shareholders to go public. You didn't have two dimes to rub together when you started this raise. You had bankrupted one company to get out of a lease and then withdrew it which to me is fraud. You keep claiming this note is investor protection but a convertible note does not survive bankruptcy (which you are good at).

you need more than a million to open the store you need deposits, cash for staffing, inventory, build out etc. You have been ""Testing the waters"" for a year and this is still a big pile of steaming crap. You are spending the money you raise on ads to raise more money and I doubt you have the 40k+ it will take to file a Reg A to raise the 1 million+ you want. Would love to see your PCAOB audits for that

Please tell us though what kind of salary are you taking?

Would you care to let us know why you have not signed the warehouse/store space you have been saying was coming for at least nine months?
Why not do a convertible note at a real valuation? You say you have 500k in assets with all those USED store furnishings. Why did you instead choose to set it at 15 million ? You want people to invest at a value the company MAY (More than likely not) will be worth in the future taking all the risks since I believe I saw you have a whopping 500 in cash of your own money and some fixtures that are questionably owned by you. I understand the note has no value but to convert you have to raise 3 million before it would convert. For you to raise 3 million the valuation would have to be 15 million or some number close to that for you to not lose control. Of course what right minded person invests three million in a business with nothing being run out of a home with no product to sell? So yes I see a guy who filed a bankruptcy to get better terms on a lease (not because he was bankrupt

Truth is there is no value to the company because you have nothing to offer other than some store fixtures for this mythological company","Hello Scott,

Actually I’m extremely pleased with our results so far and very proud to have the investors who’ve already chosen to participate in our opportunity. And in regards to your other comments, we believe we have already adequately responded to your comments about the same subjects on more than one occasion. As we have mentioned in our previous responses, it is clear to us from your repetitive negative comments that you have made up your mind from the start that you don’t like our company, our offering, and even myself personally. As we’ve also stated, while it’s unfortunate, we completely respect your freedom to have your own opinion and we recognize that it seems that it greatly differs from our own perspective. It seems completely obvious to us that it really doesn’t matter what we say or do, it won’t help or change the narrative that you have constructed about us based upon your previous judgements. As you are not a current investor, and it you’ve made it abundantly clear that you will never be an investor in our company, we don’t see the need in engaging further with any conversations which ultimately lead nowhere. In our opinion it is an exercise in futility.

I would like to leave it on a positive note that we do recognize that your heart seems to be in the right place in your efforts to uncover fraudulent companies and outright bad investment opportunities. So while we probably will never see eye to eye, we wish you nothing but the best with your other StartEngine investments and opportunities.

Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Jason Wade,8,No,11 days ago,"Rich, if it takes $1.5-$2m of capital to open each store, what do you hope to accomplish with this small raise?

Also, why would you want to suffer dramatically reduced net margins by going brick & mortar instead of just selling online?","Morning Jason,

Great questions and I’m happy to respond. There’s quite a lot of information I could cover here however I will do my best to keep it concise. Also, please forgive any typos as I’m answering from my cell phone while out. It was too important to me to get right back to you.

First of all, my quotes for a new store include all the build out, shelving, signage, displays, back warehouse, office, checkouts, computers, and any other infrastructure necessary per store. Since I already have a full 35,000 square foot stores assets ready for turn key, we are already $500K up to $1 Million ahead of the game.

The only thing we need to open the store is about $1 Million of inventory. $750K on the shelves and $250K in rotation either ordered, on the road, or in processing to make it to the floor.

This $100K raise was originally planned to always simply expand out to a $1 Million raise after we “tested the waters” with the $100K first. There’s quite a bit more upfront expense for the $1 Million raise vs the $100K due to legal and accounting costs.

The $100K was really planned to be used as a little working capital to help the process along and I expected to either expand to the $1 Million or obtain an inventory line of credit to give us the remainder of the inventory needed to fill the store.

I’ve learned throughout this campaign that we missed the mark slightly by overstating our retail concept, as we are really more of a liquidation company who specializes in being a better solution to the growing problem of retail returns and overstocks for retail both online and in stores. As online sales grow, this inventory problem is becoming a massive headache for companies like Amazon. Brick and mortar have average returns of 8% of their gross sales and online sales average about 20% up to 30%. So we’ve been more focused on how to be a solution to this problem for companies such as Amazon, while the retail stores, online sales, and now wholesale are simply different methodologies for us to turn more and more products.

The question of why brick n mortar vs online is a much bigger question, however the short answer is that the secondary market will never do well online. Bottom line is that all of the shipping and handling make it impossible to deliver the deeply discounted prices that are required to compete in this space.

There’s tons of articles and information online as to why TJ Maxx is absolutely killing it in retail ($37 Billion) and will never really be a big player online.

The last reason we are starting with a small raise here is to gain the stockholder base necessary to eventually go public which is on of our main exit plans for our investors.

Right now we’ve been heavily focused on our wholesale distribution that we’ve recently rolled out. It’s helping us cash flow while we move forward on our fundraising efforts as well as creating a much more attractive investment for new money. It also dramatically drives down the cost of new money to the company so we feel that this is a great new addition to our company plans.

It quickly became evident to me that our biggest mistake in getting into crowdfunding was underestimating the amount of money needed to market the offering. It was a foreign concept to me to spent money advertising to raise money as I’ve always been very successful doing it on my own face to face. We have simply learned from this and have made the necessary adjustments for our next round. The cash flow that we are now producing from wholesale revenues along with this seed capital, will be leveraged to expand to a much larger round and give us a marketing budget to reach the investors.

Hopefully I adequately covered everything you requested. Please feel free to reach out anytime! And thanks for the thoughtful questions.

Would you be interested in having a Southern Region like Houston Texas as a home office or base? Looking to spearhead an opportunity. What type of investment would it take to open up a distribution center and several retail outlets around town?","Good Evening Dan,

I’m always up for discussing possible growth opportunities. It’s interesting that you mention Texas because I’ve said that most likely at some point as we grow, it might make the most sense to have our base operations in Texas as it would make reaching any store throughout the country much easier for travel. That question isn’t just a simple answer as “there’s more than one way to skin a cat” as the saying goes. With that being said, each store requires about $1 Million in inventory ($750K on the shelves at all times and another $250K in rotation) with another $500K-$750K in buildout, displays, shelving, infrastructure, signage, etc with a small amount of working capital required for staffing and startup. So you could safely estimate about $1.5 Million up to $2 Million per store and maybe another $250K-$350K for a distribution center. So just a ballpark estimate for a couple of retail locations and a centralized distribution center could be a minimum of about $3.5 Million up to $5 Million. Much of what will dictate the costs will boil down to how we acquire property, the possible build outs, shelving, displays, etc. Those figures can make things very expensive or on we can find many great ways of saving money by purchasing used shelving from a closed down big box retailer for an example. Hopefully that gives you a little insight to your questions.

As stated, I’m always up for discussion of new business opportunities if you would like to chat further.

Thanks for your interest and please feel free to reach out anytime!

Thanks for answering my previous question. I had one more question, have you looked into the use of Shopify as a platform to assist with sales and exposure?

Thanks,

Jordan Talley","Good morning Jordan,

I believe Shopify is a subscription service to build your own website in order to sell. With this approach, we must work at building our brand, trust, and traffic online which takes considerable time and money. That isn’t part of our current business model. We are a true liquidator in the sense that we turn inventory as quickly as possible. So our approach for online sales is now and has always been to go where the hundreds of millions of consumers are already shopping via eBay, Amazon, and just recently Wayfair. We found it much more lucrative to simply sell there and compete on being the absolute lowest price. In this way, we sell through product as fast as possible. We leverage these massive brands marketing, traffic, trust, and even their discounted shipping rates in order to turn inventory.

Thanks again,

Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Jordan Talley,7,No,2 months ago,"Hello Rich,

I’m interested in placing an investment, particularly with the convertible note offering. I was wondering the status on the first store opening and any updates on sales?

Thank you,

Jordan Talley","Hi Jordan,

Thanks so much for the interest.

Our current plans are to have the new store in Henderson open by the 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2020. Right now we are mainly focused on our newest direction of wholesale and generating revenues for the company during the transition into the new space. As we have only begun selling this way last month, our first real month of sales will be this month of December. Due to an unfortunate delay in receiving our inventory shipment in a timely manner, we will most likely only sell off about half of our inventory by year end. However there is still a very strong chance that we will sell out of our inventory completely.

We are in discussions now with a large industry supplier with whom we have done business with now for almost 10 years creating a possible strategic alliance for new inventory procurement. We also have been approached by a retailer on the East Coast who has been in business for over 20 years to possibly rebrand their operations under our brand name and at the same time are being pursued by several potential owner/operators looking to possibly ""franchise"" locations in California and Utah.

There's actually much more we have in the pipeline that will be disclosed over the next several months. This is definitely the most excited I have been about our business in a long time and I can hardly wait to share it with our Crowdfunding family of investors.

Have a terrific day!

Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,William Jacobsen,2,No,3 months ago,What is the Cost per share?,"Hi William,

This is actually an offering for convertible notes, which is essentially a loan to the company that earns 10% interest until the point that they do convert into shares of the company. We chose this route because it gives you as an investor all the security of a debt structure during this early stage of growth, then it converts to equity at a 20% discount from what the new investments pay per share. We believe this is the absolute best option for you and I will give an example as to what could happen in this situation.

Let’s assume you were to invest $1,000 today and it took us a year to convert your notes into shares, and the new investors were to pay $1 per share a year from now. At the point of conversion, you would have earned $100 worth of interest giving you a total of $1,100 value at conversion. Your 20% discount will give you shares at $0.80 per share. Your initial investment of $1,000 would convert into 1,375 shares worth $1 per share for a total value of $1,375 worth of common stock in the company. That’s a possible return of 37.5% earned on your money in the first year alone! We anticipate taking the company public in the future so your shares could potentially be worth many times multiple.

On the downside if we were to not reach our goals for some unfortunate reason, as a convertible note holder you are protected by the value of the company assets in the case of a liquidation. Shareholders come behind debt holders so they are not as protected on the downside.

We see this as the best option for our crowdfunding investors coming in now.

Thanks for your interest and please feel free to reach out anytime!

In your most recent response to me you claimed "" We are definitely happy and excited that we've raised the amount we have because we have done it all without any marketing budget"" yet you started your advertising with DNA Agency over 4 months ago and even advertised and I quote""
New Marketing Efforts Brings Amazing and Unexpected Results!
We have since partnered with the Digital Niche Agency to roll out our social media advertising campaign which have been live now for only a few weeks time.""..

That wasn't free? You paid a couple grand for them to be set up + 20% or more of the total ad spend. You were touting the amazing results yet you stopped. What was your ROI? Why did you stop? Why did you lie and say there was no ad budget?

Three months ago you said ""$60,000 Investments As of Today with Minimal Advertising Expenditure
First off you spent 3k but you just said you had no advertising so far in your response. 2nd you still didn't answer what happened to that money? Why did the big investor pull it back? Why did you just lie and say you had not advertised?
14 days ago you posted in an investor update "" We have also just executed a new contract with the Digital Niche Agency (DNA) to handle all of our social media marketing content. They were responsible for completing our initial advertising test run, which to both our company's pleasant surprise, returned much better than expected results....

The reality is rich that you are running a ponzi scheme so to speak with the advertising. Getting some money from investors, running ads hoping you get more than you spend so you can reinvest it. The reality is you have no money in this company, no outside money invested you keep alluding to, no retail space nor a hope of getting one because you have no money yet you keep talking about the coming soon space. I am familiar with the Vegas real estate market and if you had cash you could have had several spaces in Summerlin Was even a nice space at the premium outlets there. Bottom line this is going nowhere have no cash yet keep discussing pipe dreams. Yes I understand a convertible note. I am an accredited investor. I also understand you have no chance of this working by your own admission you cant open. You discuss liquidation for the note but there is nothing to liquidate. You are so far in over your head here in my opinion you are going to drown. After your first 24 hours you have raised 28k","Scott,

There have been no “lies” as you put it. I said that we’ve done it without any real marketing budget which is true. We did a short test run as you pointed out and we are just now rolling out a small advertising budget, so the money raised to date was done without any long term advertising program such as what is done by the larger campaigns. I’m sorry however I don’t consider our test run an actual market campaign or budget. Our media spend of a few thousand dollars in the first test campaign is a far cry from the $10K to $15K per month that others are spending at a minimum as I’ve been told.

To address the two investors who dropped, it was over a timing technicality when we did our 60 day extension. The extension is considered a “material change” to the offering according to the SEC. All investors whose funds hadn’t yet cleared need to respond via email within a few days with reconfirmation. They simply missed the deadline and Startengine canceled their investments. I’m not actually worried about those investors at this time.

What you call a “ponzi scheme” is actually what the team at Startengine recommends to businesses as a normal practice that is done by most companies raising on the platform. They have advised us that companies start out with friends and family and after raising a little funds on Startengine, begin reinvesting their newly acquired capital into social media marketing and so on. That’s exactly how their staff has told us most companies do it.

I will say that my hesitation comes from spending advertising money just to raise money. It was a very foreign idea for me and I was a bit stubborn to conform as I would have preferred to do it without having to do so. However this way of raising capital is a completely different animal and I’ve learned that social media is truly the best way to reach our audience so now I’m on board with the program.

Like I have stated, it seems quite obvious to me that it really doesn’t matter what I say as for some reason you’ve decided that you simply don’t like our offering. We completely respect your decision and wish you on the best with your other investments."
Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Scott Tobia,4,No,5 months ago,"Rich against my better judgement I will respond. First lets discuss your raise and your comparison to Red Lilly. You started your raise back in February possibly January. You have raised an amazing $5,674 a month. In that time you were over 50k at one point until a large investor pulled out after coming to their senses. Would you care to enlighten us on why that happened? Why with all your hype of how great the raise is going are you only averaging 5k a month?

Would you care to let us know why you have not signed the warehouse/store space you have been saying was coming for at least four months?

Would you care to explain the false bankruptcy you filed to get better terms on a lease?

Would you care to explain to your ""Convertible Note"" holders why you wouldn't do that to them?

Would you care to explain why a single cent of the money you have raised has not at least went to product you could have sold on Amazon and Ebay for a profit to at least show something positive to investors? Maybe because you are living off of it?


Why not do a convertible note at a real valuation? You say you have 500k in assets with all those USED store furnishings. Why did you instead choose to set it at 15 million ? You want people to invest at a value the company MAY (More than likely not) will be worth in the future taking all the risks since I believe I saw you have a whopping 500 in cash of your own money and some fixtures that are questionably owned by you. I understand the note has no value but to convert you have to raise 3 million before it would convert. For you to raise 3 million the valuation would have to be 15 million or some number close to that for you to not lose control. Of course what right minded person invests three million in a business with nothing being run out of a home with no product to sell? So yes I see a guy who filed a bankruptcy to get better terms on a lease (not because he was bankrupt) who could do the same thing to the note holders and laugh all the way to the bank again. Red lilly did have a legit valuation something you don't have.

Your goal is not to help as many people as possible with this investment in my opinion. It is a last ditch effort to try and salvage something you lost through poor decisions (like the previous lease) Maybe some folks will get a good deal on used stuff and investors are being overcharged for nothing in my opinion.

Moving to the stock website I will say this. It looks like the things they have","Hey Scott,

We are definitely happy and excited that we've raised the amount we have because we have done it all without any marketing budget. We have been told by every CEO from at least a half dozen companies with whom we spoke to that have successfully raised at least a million dollars on crowdfunding that this is an absolute necessity. So yes, we consider it a big win and are extremely appreciative of all of our current investors who came to us organically.

We actually hired a corporate consultant, who has extensive experience in building companies and taking them public, to develop our plans for capital. They advised us of the best ways to set up the investors and the company for success in this round and in future rounds of investment. This is how we came to the decisions of what is best for all investors, now and in the future.

You are definitely correct that we aren't yet in a place to bring in the $3 Million worth of capital today. However that wasn't what I was saying as that was never the plan. The investors, with whom we already have met, are interested in the equity investment for growth and expansion once we are open and operating in the new location. Again, this is the point of using the convertible note for now and it's subsequent conversion later with the bonus discount given to these investors for getting in early.

It is quite clear to me from your comments that you still may not completely understand convertible notes, a company's reorganization of debts, and the most important thing which is the protection of debt holders who have priority above all shareholders in the case of a bankruptcy. To clarify, in your proposed scenario of a bankruptcy, the exact opposite of what you are suggesting happens. The convertible note holders will be paid first after the liquidation of assets and the shareholders such as myself would get whatever is remaining, if anything. This was my exact point in my previous response that in a ""worst case"" scenario of a bankruptcy, the convertible note holders have security where they would not as shareholders and it is a far better protection mechanism for the investors at this time.

Although it is very unfortunate, from your comments, it seems to me that very early on you made the decision that you don't like our offering, our Company, or myself which causes you to base all of your judgements on this negative point of view. At this point, I believe it really doesn't matter what I say, as you simply are not going to like any answer I provide.

I do wish you good luck in all of your investments which you do choose to participate."
Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Scott Tobia,4,No,5 months ago,"Rich,

Was reading some comments down below and your answers. What makes you think someone is going to invest 3-5 million in your company when even the lowest sophisticated investor(CF investors for the most part) wont give you money? You have no product, no building, no cash. Why would someone give you three million?


Your biggest problem is trying to use this well it will convert to equity at 15 million maybe minus the discount blah blah blah. You should have had a priced round with a 6 million valuation, $100 minimum instead of trying to screw people and say well we don't know how to value the company. Truth is there is no value to the company because you have nothing to offer other than some store fixtures for this mythological unicorn store you are dreaming of.

I would encourage you who are considering investing to take a look at this review. http://mvpstockpicks.com/open-box-buy-equity-crowd-funding-review-beware/","Hey Scott,

So it’s obvious that you personally do not like our offer which is absolutely your choice and we respect your decision. However based on results of investments within the crowdfunding offering as well as outside of the offering it is clearly obvious that we have many more investors who do like what we have to offer. I’m not sure why you choose to waste your time reviewing our offering when you’ve clearly made your own judgement based on your own misunderstandings. Unfortunately we’ve already attempted and it is very clear based on your “$15 Million blah blah” comment that we have failed to help you understand that this is a convertible note and there is no valuation set at this time. Contrary to what you believe, this is by far the best protection we can give an early investor as this is a debt to the company and not yet an equity investment.

By structuring it as a convertible note, in the worst case scenario of a failure in the early stage of a new company, these investors are protected by having claim against all assets in a dissolution. This is not the case for equity investors, such as myself, who would get nothing. This is specifically why convertible notes are so attractive to more sophisticated investors and most often used in early stage companies such as ours.

It is disappointing to hear that you believe somehow our intent is to hurt someone when our goal is obviously to help as many people as we possibly can. We do this by saving people money with the products we carry, creating new job opportunities, as well as offering investment participation for others to share in our success.

I actually encourage our investors to check out any reviews. I would like to point out some of our own “red flag” questions about the specific site you mentioned.

First, why do they offer stock opinions On a website providing absolutely no resumes, bios, or portfolio proof of any success that their recommendations have any credibility.
Secondly, from their comments about us, do they understand the value of a convertible note and it’s protections over common stockholders in early stage companies? Or do they understand that a valuation cap is absolutely not a current value to a company of any kind? Thirdly, what can we learn from their choices of highly recommending Red Lilly Management, who unfortunately didn’t even raise the minimum of $10K? At the same time they negatively reviewed our company who raised over $11K within our first 24 hours and are now surpassing $40K (Not including any outside investments).

Again, we completely understand that we are not a fit for you as an investment, and we only wish you the best of luck in all of your other investments!"
Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Dennis Wurm,,No,9 months ago,How many shares do we receive with the purchase of 250$???,"Good Morning Dennis,

Our offering is a convertible note, which is actually a debt to the company until it converts into equity at a later date. Simply put, you will be loaning the company $250 and earning an interest rate of 10% on your loan until the point that it does convert into equity.

We anticipate successfully funding an equity round in the near future of approximately $3 Million up to $5 Million. It is at this point that we will have effectively set not only the company valuation as well as the prices per share of stock by this equity purchase. It is at this point that you will convert your notes. You will also receive a bonus of a 20% discount off the price paid by these new investors.

So for an example: if you were to purchase $250 worth of convertible notes today and it took us 1 Year exactly to raise the $3 Million equity round, then you will have $275 worth of equity to convert. Hypothetically, if the new investors are to pay $1 per share, you would be converting your $275 at a rate of $0.80 per share. This would give you roughly 344 shares for your $250 investment while the new investors will only have 250 shares for their $250.

Hopefully this answers your question and I appreciate your interest in our offering! Please feel free to reach out anytime should you have any more questions.

Best regards,

Open Box Buy,https://www.startengine.com/openboxbuy,Charles Hall,3,No,a year ago,"Hello, Rich:

I must say that some of the previous comments and questions have put you through the wringer. I have appreciated reading your responses to them. You seem quite sincere. My question is much simpler. First, I have always been leery of open box and refurbished products. I wonder how many other people might share this reservation and how it may affect your sales. I kind of think of such products as items that someone else has already found defective and has been unsuccessful in obtaining any remedy. Will your products come with any kind of guarantee that might overcome the reluctance to buy of an individual like me? Thanks for your attention.

Charles","Hey Charles,

Thanks for the kind words. I will say that I am exactly who I am coming off to be as you put it. I really believe in what I do as well as being a conduit for helping others. Not only do I see Open Box Buy as an opportunity to help others by providing great products at a deep discount which saves them money, I also see this crowdfunding opportunity to share the wealth with a bunch of ""regular folk"" just like me and not only for the more wealthy ""accredited investors"". Please don't take that the wrong way because I appreciate the accredited investors just as much as non-accredited, however with this fundraising vehicle I see that we can take basically everyone along with us while we build something amazing together.

I will acknowledge that at first, some of the comments really bothered me because I really do take my business personally and sometimes it is hard not to do so when I've poured so much of my time, money, and soul into this business. However I also realize that these are also just good people looking out for their own investments as well as looking to protect others from investing in a loser. I'm willing to bet that most who have been on the aggressive with me have been burned at some point in the past by an investment that didn't work out or by investing in a partner, CEO, or entrepreneur who was out for themselves and not for their investors.

I believe the success of a company is 50/50. Which is to say that 50% comes from the ""widget"", whether it is a car, a restaurant, or a technological gadget and the other 50% comes from it's people. So I put just as much weight in the success of a company in it's founder, employees, investors, and anyone else involved in delivering the ""widget"". I believe that the better I take care of my employees, partners, and investors, the better they will take care of our customers and the more success we will all have as a direct result.

And to answer your question directly, that is what makes us stand out as a retailer. We have always given a 30 day money back guarantee to all of our customers which gives them the piece of mind that their purchases are always safe with us. By doing this, it offers two big benefits to the company:

1. The first benefit is that the customer trusts us and is more comfortable with making their purchase as they feel protected.
2. The second is by providing this guarantee to the customer, we can actually receive a better price for the products because of the added value given by the guarantee. For example, if you were to buy a $100 item ""as-is"" with no guarantee or return policy, then as a customer you might only pay $30 for the item. Because I give the 30 day money back guarantee, I can easily get $50-$60 for the same item because if for some reason they don't like it, they can just bring it back.

And what does it really matter to me as a retailer of open box, closeout, or refurbished items if it is returned to our store? We simply have our inventory technicians process the inventory and put it right back out on the shelf as long as it is returned in the same as-new condition in which we sold it.

I can also share quite a bit of insight into the world of customer returns as I have learned quite a lot over the years from our retail suppliers. I have purchased many truckloads of customer returns which have included manifests with their internal notes as to why the items were returned and it is safe to say that about 90% of returns are from ""changed mind"", ""no longer wanted"", or ""buyers remorse"" listed as the reasons. These internal lists have come from Walmart, Macys, Kohls, Sams Club, Costco, Amazon, and almost every other national retailer from which we continually purchase products.

Just a quick google search produces many different articles all saying the same thing such as this article from 2015 titles top 10 reasons people return products. https://chargeback.com/top-10-reasons-for-a-product-return/ Just a spoiler alert, defective item isn't even on the list!

It is also important to note that most major manufacturers will still honor their warranty because they stand behind their products and their brand, not necessarily the stores in which they are sold. Some do not, however I have found that the majority of big companies do.

In the past, we have also offered extended warranties through big insurance companies such as Square Trade, however in recent years they stopped covering open box or refurbished products through retailers such as myself. Our future plans are to create a subsidiary company to OBB which will cover these extended warranties and for a very reasonable cost, we will offer them to our customer base for up to 2-3 years of additional warranty through our stores. Not only will this add further value to our customers, it will also be another source of revenues to the company. Because we already have a fully trained technical staff, we can also complete all of the warranty claims ourselves which will further keep our costs to a minimum.

So in a nutshell, we have got your covered!

I'd like to clarify what our product does and does not do. TrellaGro LST is designed to control the direction of plant growth, to increase yield and to keep the height low so it can be used short spaces. It is not a self-contained grow chamber like Seedo. TrellaGro LST controls the plant, Seedo controls the environment and is not suited for commercial use and not capable of growing a 6 ft. tall plant in a 3 ft. tall space like TrellaGro LST. We're focused on getting tall plants and trees indoors.

TrellaGro LST can be placed in grow tents, in a closet, in a freight container, in a large warehouse on the floor or placed on shelves. The user provides the lights, nutrients, HVAC, etc. We designed TrellaGro LST to be versatile so that it can be included in a variety of growing conditions.

Our electrical power consumption is very low. We're running at 30 Watts right now, that's less than a lightbulb. If a grower would like to use our device, and if they are considering the use of a solar power supply our low power consumption would be the least of their concerns. They also need to provide power for their lights, HVAC and other equipment within their respective space.

We stand by our statement that you can run TrellaGro LST with solar energy, whether as the primary source or as back-up, but it does not come with its own solar battery/supply.

Thanks for checking out our page! Currently, we're offering two models, Model 4 and Model 6. Model 4 has a canopy area of 2' x 4' and Model 6 is our larger unit at 2' x 6'. The retail price for Model 4 is $5,540 but is currently available at an introductory reduced price of $4,490. For Model 6 the price is reduced from $6540 to $5540.

Currently, we do not have a further reduced price for investors. If we update our campaign, we can include a new perk at that time.

However when I sawthe price point of your product I was completely turned away. Can you explain to me as someone who grows produce, not cannabis, how this product economically feasible to use?","Hello Terrie,

Thanks for your question. Our short-term target market is the cannabis and hemp farmer as our design helps to both reduce operating costs (saves time, and energy) and increases yield for their lucrative crop. As we refine the design, and the manufacturing process we will be able to reduce our costs and transfer that reduction to our new customers in the general produce market.

Our design is also helpful for indoor cultivators growing in remote locations OR for those not able to tend to their plants on a frequent (practically daily) basis. We also use a low-stress training technique which results in faster growth and more harvest per year. However, if what you're growing is not comparable to the retail price of hemp flower, it may not be the device for you...at this time.

As we mention in our video, Trella is about more than cannabis, we're trying to grow trees indoors. But at this time, our prices are based on our costs to manufacture and assemble our product in the US. We're focused on getting our costs reduced, so we can share our technology with as many people as possible.

The reduction of energy costs, carbon emmissions is also a concern, but not on the top three of their pain point list.

I invested in your company because I like your passion and your vision. How are you different from other future farming companies like Aero Farms and what puts your company in a better position moving forward?

Thanks,
Tim","Good morning Tim,

Thank you for your investment, support, and belief in our mission.

As we studied the indoor and vertical farming industry, we noted a lot of other companies such as Aero Farms, Freight Farms, etc. They're amazing companies and an inspiration for us as well. They've put a lot of focus and energy into automating and/or controlling the environment around the plant such as the temperature, lighting, nutrient delivery, etc. However, they do not automate or control the plant's structure. Due to the layout and physical arrangement (tight vertical spacing, limited overhead height) their systems are not designed for taller plants. Which limits the types of markets they can tap into. If you wanted to use their system for something such as tall cannabis strains, hemp (for CBD flower) or fruit-bearing plants you would have to significantly modify the physical layout, and then hire staff to manually trellis and train the plants to ensure they don't grow out of control within a compact space.

That's where TrellaGro LST™ can help. We've focused our energy into automating and controlling the shape of the plant, so that you could expand the use of the systems like Aero Farms and Freight Farms into growing taller plants vs. just microgreens, lettuce, etc. We also automate that step so that it does not require additional labor or operating costs to control the plant shape. We're actually building relationships with a couple of container farming companies with a goal to become our partners and/or clients.

I hope this answers your question. Please let me know otherwise and have a great day!"

Trella Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/trella,Troy Anthony Dailey,,No,9 months ago,What’s your exit strategy?,"Hello Troy,

Thanks for taking the time to review our offering! To answer your question:

As you may have noted, our intellectual property protection includes both US and foreign countries. Our short-term plan includes distribution throughout the US & Canada. However, our ultimate goal includes the ability to spread our technology throughout the world. For that, we will need a substantial infrastructure in order to distribute globally. Therefore, our exit strategy consists of strategic acquisition by a larger company with the capacity for global distribution. We've seen an increase in Agtech mergers and acquisitions, especially those with a focus on ""next-gen farms"" or ""robotics & automation"".

Trella Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/trella,P M,,No,10 months ago,"I do buy into this idea and your potential.

However, the terms offered are discouraging. If I am reading correctly, until your first qualified investment round my returns would be capped at 10-30%. Thus campaign supporters miss out on the most intensive value creation period, but still bear the risks of a startup. Why shouldn't one just wait out until said speculated investment round, and then try to acquire mature class B units from people who invest now on the promised StartEngine Secondary marketplace?

Some questions about the technology itself:

1) The yield of 2.2 oz/sq ft. is from two racks stacked on top of each other, which according to Indiegogo, would together retail for $10000, correct? It would be very helpful if ""Let's compare"" section above listed Impact on labor in man-hours times average salary to see the economic effect better.

2) Why does a user need a remote-control app with monitoring features if the system is supposed to be automatic?

3) Machine learning algorithms can be trained once you have thousands of units operating and feeding data to a central server at the same time, possibly including camera feeds from inside racks. Further, if the app requires a separate subscription, this limits the dataset. I think first customers could well be happy with just lab-derived presets for growing different strains. What would the data dimensions be in addition to temperature and humidity, anyway? Wouldn't packing the product with more sensors make it more expensive, with benefits only in the future?

Knowing nothing, it still looks that involving ML and mobile apps at this time would divert R&D and resources from the core ""mechanical"" part of the product with only a marginal benefit. A quick search brought up for example https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-20/at-this-high-tech-farm-the-boss-is-an-ai-powered-algorithm, maybe you could partner with them on the ML part instead of reinventing?

I'm just exploring here, but it's still the most intriguing company on this website.

Regards","Hello PM,

First, we’d like to thank you for your kind words. >> “…the most intriguing company on this website.”

We appreciate your feedback and questions. Please see our responses below:

Our Offering:
One of the main benefits of acquiring a convertible note includes the presence of a discount rate and accrued interest. Upon conversion, you’ll receive more units (shares), and you'll pay a lower discounted price than those who wait until after conversion. If you decide to sell your units at the time of conversion, your ROI may be limited as you estimate. But, most convertible note holders do not sell their units (shares), in order to take advantage of the discount and interest received for equity. With equity, the ROI would be based on the value of the company at acquisition/exit.

The option to resell securities is currently limited and the launch of the “StartEngine Secondary” platform is pending. But let’s assume the secondary marketplace is launched: As a convertible noteholder, you would receive units (shares) at a discounted price. For example, if the price is $10/unit, for those who participate in this offering, the price is reduced to $8/unit. If you then want to sell your units on the marketplace, you would sell it for more than $8/unit or you would take a loss. You’d want the highest bid. If you wait to purchase the Class B units after conversion, you may have to pay a higher price per unit as the seller does not want to take a loss. So, it’s a matter of getting into the marketplace at a lower price, and with more units (due to interest received).

Our Technology:
Our yield is based on the canopy area, so the combined yield for two levels would cover both the top and lower canopy area. For more, please see “Sustainable Farming Example”. In this example, we use a 40 ft. container to show annual yield based on canopy area. Please also see our “Offering Detail” document (click the “Offering Detail” button) and scroll down to the “Current Stage and Roadmap” section at the top of page 5 for our pricing structure. Regarding labor, based on our operation and estimates it can reduce labor costs by 33%. This will vary depending on the operation. Thanks for the great suggestion to modify the infographic to include labor in man-hours.

The app does not control the unit but provides the user with up-to-date information regarding the growth rate and environmental conditions. This can be done from a remote location vs. going into the grow room to verify which removes another opportunity for contamination.

Regarding the machine learning aspect, sensors and app development, as you suggest, we are developing relationships with existing AgTech AI companies. There’s an opportunity for strategic partnerships to utilize their existing technology with our product. We met several during our trade show events and they also see the opportunity for synergy!

Thanks again for your questions and feedback and please let us know if you have any other questions!"
Trella Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/trella,SHOUA LO,5,No,10 months ago,"This is a good idea and concept but the idea of stretching the plant is nothing new to marijuana plants. It has been done several years ago. There are videos on YouTube that illustrate the steps of what known as ""topping"" which forces the lower branches to grow while the top branch is stunned and grows at a slower rate. This creates more top branches and yields are increased exponentially depending on how many top branches are created.","Hello Shoua Lo, we agree with you 100%.

The method of training your plants to grow sideways is not new. Humans have been training plants for millennia. It's a tested and proven method. And now, with TrellaGro LST it can be done automatically! The automation reduces labor, operating costs and reduce human error which can lead to inconsistent results (yield, cannabinoids, terpenes, etc). This will be a major win for cannabis cultivators as the markets stiffen and wholesale prices drop. To remain profitable, cultivation will need to be done in the most efficient manner possible. This is where we can help. The AUTOMATION is key...and it's never been done before.

For more information, please feel free to check out Aja's talk at the New England Cannabis Convention in Boston, MA where she discusses manual plant training methods (including topping) and how these existing methods led to the creation of the TrellaGro LST: https://youtu.be/Kr4DrRC2wrw

Trella Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/trella,Jacob Britsch,,No,10 months ago,"Really nice idea! I would assume that a larger pot would be necessary to allow for maximum root growth to support that vegetation and flowering. Also, is it easy to water/feed the plant with this system or does it become difficult as the plant grows?","Hi Jacob, thanks for the comment! Depending on the grow media (user selected), a larger pot/container may be required since the plant is allowed to reach its maximum potential. Regarding water/feeding, the pot/grow container is stationary and located where the plant starts its growth. We have user accessible areas on the side of the unit. For a visual representation, please see the video titled ""The VR Experience"" located above ""The Benefits of Automated Low-Stress Training"". Thanks and let us know if you have any other questions!"
Trella Technologies,https://www.startengine.com/trella,Lucas Beckner,3,No,a year ago,"Is this machine splitting the buds as they grow to create more steps or replanting the seeding multiple times? If you’re replanting, then it won’t be legally considered 1 plant. I see this as potential competition for me but when marijuana becomes legal for recreational use in my state, residents are only aloud to grow 6 plants without a license.","Hi Lucas! Thanks for asking.

No, we are not splitting buds. We are using a low-stress training technique which doesn’t involve trimming or cutting the plant in any manner. Please check out our See It in Action video (second image from top). In that video, you’ll see that we hold the plant at one end where the root system and grow media container are located. Then, based on the growth rate of the plant (using sensors) we use automation to slowly and gently move the top of the plant horizontally down the pathway until it gets to the end.

This creates one plant, with the main stem in the horizontal direction. In this manner, every branch gets optimum light.

If you’d like further explanation, please follow us on Facebook as I’ll be speaking at the New England Cannabis Convention in Boston tomorrow, Sunday at 1 pm EST. We plan to record it LIVE. During this presentation, I’ll cover the various plant training methods, high vs. low stress, and how TrellaGro LST works. Hope you can catch it live, we can also share the recording here on StartEngine so others can see it as well.

Awesome questions and thanks for taking the time to check out our offering.

Regarding your questions:
1. For pricing information please see our Offering Details document, ""Current Stage & Roadmap"" section on page 5. Regarding COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), we estimate a 50-60% profit margin taking into account (Model Type, Bill of Materials, Labor, Service and Delivery). We understand that this does not include overhead/additional expenses. As we grow, we expect the COGS will be reduced as we work to refine the design and manufacturing process.

2. Awesome suggestion! This was one of the first comments we received from a longtime grower in the city of Boston, MA. We've added this feature to our next generation list. We would love to determine the effects of direct & controlled CO2 application (vs. room/environmental application).

XTI Aircraft,https://www.startengine.com/xti-aircraft,Simpson Brown,2,No,14 days ago,Where do you park this thing when traveling city to city?,"Hi Simpson... There are many places where it is legal and safe for the TriFan 600 to land and take off, including the 5,500 helipads/heliports in the U.S. alone, as well as job sites, parks, large back yards, golf courses, and anywhere else that's safe and legal. Those existing heliport operations provide for storing/""parking"" aircraft there, just like regional airports allow private airplanes to be parked at those airports. Of course, there are and will be many places and cities where the closest landing site is not exactly where the final destination is, but the small area needed for landing and takeoff will be much closer than any airport, and it will be a short walk or ride to that final destination."
XTI Aircraft,https://www.startengine.com/xti-aircraft,Richard Garcia,5,Yes,a month ago,"Hi, David.

Who are your primary competitors, and what are the greatest risks to this project (other than potentially not raising enough capital? Thank you.

Rich","Hi Richard -- XTI has no direct competitors that are developing a vertical takeoff airplane that can achieve the [performance specifications that we expect from the TriFan 600. The AgustaWestland 609 tiltrotor is the closest competing aircraft that exists because it has wings and is a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. However, the 609 is more like a helicopter than a fixed-wing business airplane, and a brief review of the AW 609 specs compared to the our TriFan 600 demonstrates that the AW 609 can't actually compete with us. The TriFan will cruise at 350 mph, compared to the AW 609 speed of 275 mph. We project the range of the TriFan will be around 1,000 miles, while the 609's range is only 675 miles. The base price of the TriFan will be $6.5 million, while if you reserve the AgustaWestland tiltrotor you will have to pay over $20 million for it. Regarding your question about risk, until we demonstrate transition from vertical takeoff to cruise in one of our prototypes, and vice versa, we regard that as the most significant technical risk. However, we've conducted extensive CFD analysis (""computational fluid dynamics"", which are computerized wind tunnel tests) and have substantial information, along with detailed reviews by some of the leading aerospace engineers in the world, that gives us confidence that the transition will not be a problem for the TriFan."
XTI Aircraft,https://www.startengine.com/xti-aircraft,Henri Heinonen,3,Yes,a month ago,"@David Brody Hi! You are welcome. :)

I think flying cars need to be VTOL capable. I hope you can use this XTI TriFan 600 technology for a flying car someday. Do you think it is possible?","Henri -- The term ""flying cars"" has two main definitions: (1) the all-electric short range ""urban air taxis"" that are being developed by literally hundreds of companies around the world today; and (2) an aircraft that can be converted into an actual automobile and be driven on roads. Both types of aircraft are fundamentally different from the TriFan 600 which is long distance, fast and hybrid-electric. In order to develop a VTOL aircraft that can ""instantaneously"" be capable of driving down the street after it lands (and vice versa), would require a design and technology in which XTI is not interested at the present time. Of course, the main advantage of VTOL is to fly over the traffic and land point-to-point, rather than landing and ""joining"" the traffic. Also, it's very challenging from a regulatory standpoint to qualify as either a car or an aircraft. It's even more difficult to qualify for both in one vehicle. There are several reasons that I don't foresee a large market for a VTOL flying car in the near future."

As an example u said: ""let's assume (as a hypothetical) the valuation of XTI is ten times greater in three years, your shares will have a value of $15.00/share.

U said ""Valuation is based on shares outstanding multiplied times the share price, not the other way around"" they should equal the same(AxB = BxA).

If the company's valuation more than doubled but my shares are still worth the same $450 I paid for them then if in a future round u determine the valuation to be 100M the shares will stay at $1.50? How do investors get a return if the share price doesn't go up with higher valuation???","Leonardo -- I'll try to clear this up... As soon as XTI received SEC approval to amend our campaign and increase the share price, XTI's valuation increased ""automatically"" to around $50 million because XTI's ability to sell shares at $1.50 ""proved"" that the value of the company was then increased to $1.50 x number of shares. If you bought your shares at $1.50, the company's valuation at that time was not $22.5 million. That number might have been stated as a technical requirement, as required by the SEC at the outset of the amended campaign, but the actual valuation, as reflected by the amount for which the investors now purchase XTI shares is the more accurate reflection of value. You have the right to sell your shares (to another private investor) now or in the future. When XTI is no longer selling shares on StartEngine, and let's assume (as a hypothetical) the valuation of XTI is ten times greater in three years, your shares will have a value of $15.00/share.

I invested when the pre-money valuation was about $22,500,000. If it went up to $51,470,577 shouldn't the share price have gone up as well??? How can my 300 shares be still worth the same $450 even though the valuation more than doubled? Please clarify and help me understand the logic here. Thanks.","Hi Leonardo -- When XTI started the campaign, the share price was $1.00, and it sounds like you purchased some shares for $1.00. After many positive developments, the company determined that the value of the entire company (and therefore all shares owned and to be issued) were worth more than $1.00, and we increased the share price to $1.50. Your 300 shares are worth the same amount that other investors are now agreeing to pay, namely, $1.50 each. Like shares of any company -- including the shares of companies traded on stock exchanges -- share price fluctuates up and down daily. In the case of XTI's shares, the most accurate indication of share price is the offering price that people are paying at any given time. Valuation is based on shares outstanding multiplied times the share price, not the other way around. I hope this answers your question."

- Grass/ Hard Dirt/Packed Earth - We are developing custom stakes that can be screwed into the earth and then snapped onto our frame feet
- Sand/Loose Earth - We are developing custom stakes with a wider screw flange to hold into sandy soils, typically found in coastal regions or on golf courses.
- Beach Sand - We are developing quick-load sand pouches that clip to each foot and can be loaded up with the sand at the beach.
Thank you again for your question,
We hope you choose to join our team,

Airemos,https://www.startengine.com/airemos,Dawn C Lett,2,No,25 days ago,"Hello Ryan- LOVE the idea. Love the technology. Love the patents. Love US born and bred. Love VETERANS working. The Valuation however, not so much. Maybe you should consult with professionals who will help establish a valuation. I will be following and cheering for your every success. You are on my radar. DLett","Thank you so much for the LOVE :)
We are working hard to make this happen and are already receiving orders for 2020!
We have worked with several professional mentors and evaluated the market landscape for competitive products we may potentially disrupt. The valuation is not derived from existing sales as much as the opportunities that are awaiting our debut. An example is a sports bench cover that is now required by many leagues to protect athletes. The competition for these bench covers (one example here - - https://www.networldsports.com/soccer/field-equipment/soccer-team-benches/forza-aluminum-team-shelter.html - -) can be between $1,000 - 5,000% of our future cost of goods. Meaning profit margins. This is just one hypothetical example and is only used to show the potential disruption of existing markets that have not yet been realized.
I will work tirelessly, effectively and efficiently to reach our $7,500,000 dollars in sales as quickly as possible.
Thank you,
-Ryan @ Airemos"
Airemos,https://www.startengine.com/airemos,Ross Santos,,No,25 days ago,"Ryan, I have two questions:
1. does the fan need to run constantly or once the structure is up, can it be shut off?
2. how do you deflate it and long does it take?","Hello Ross and thank you for the questions.
1) The inflator does not need to continuously run. Once the frame is inflated to working pressure, the pump is removed and the frame will stay pressurized until the air is released through the deflate valves.
2) Depending on the frame diameter (which can vary in volume), once the designated deflate valves are opened, the major load of air is forced out of the frame naturally by pressure. The remaining air is rolled out of the frame during pack up. This whole process take around 90-seconds with our current 10'x10' structure and just a few minutes with our 12'x12' structure. Here is a real time video of the 12'x12' going from full inflation to the bag. https://youtu.be/_aCxJxgz7RQ"

It is in the public interest to know who will be heading the company and wether one of the partners will be owed money by the company. I'm not going to invest if the money is going to be used to buy one of the partners out of their shares...?,Will - Equities are already divided based on the original paperwork and amendments filed with the Secretary of State and the IRS. None of the money raised in the previous or current campaigns will be used for acquisitions or buyouts with any of our stockholders.

The Company might incur Irregular Use of Proceeds that may include but are not limited to the following over $10,000: Inter company debt or back payments. Salary payments made to one’s self, a friend or relative.

??????????????","Miles - Good comment. During the financial audit process preparing for the launch of the campaign it turned up that there is an outstanding loan of 14k owed to the owners of the company. The loan is not interest bearing and there is not currently any repayment terms. The Founders and Owners do not currently draw a salary, bonus or payback of any kind. Assuming the valuation and profitability continue to improve we've reserved the right to a salary and/or other compensation payout. This is pretty common practice in startup of a business. We risk the capital, put in the sweat equity and hope for success. Thank you."
Franny's Manufacturing,https://www.startengine.com/frannys-manufacturing,Miles Chernovich,,No,6 days ago,"I'm confused. Your SEC filings say that there is no parent company for the Franny's brand, and that this company will sell the products to Franny's distribution (a separate company owned by you) for a 40 percent markup. That means that you are using this as a shell company to net 40 percent returns before anything is actually sold to the market by selling it to another company that you own, and since there is no parent company, investors in the distribution company are footing the bill to pay the manufacturing company. Am I missing something here?","Miles - First thing to remember is that the Manufacturing business has its own drop ship, white label and private label accounts. The Distribution Company does current represent the largest account for Manufacturing and the Franchise Company represents the largest group of accounts for the the Distribution business. We've built multiple revenue streams into each of the independent companies to help insulate them from shifts in the market. Now that we've publicly sold equity in both the Distribution and Manufacturing companies we're committed to limiting adjustments in the relationship between the two. Ultimately it is in our and our stockholders best interest to build all of the companies to highest valuation we can possibly achieve and that is what we're committed to. Thank you."

Whether or not they're safe products, how can you protect your business from the SEC if they catch wind that you are raising money to manufacture products that are currently illegal?
From the FDA website: "" No. There are no other FDA-approved drug products that contain CBD. ...Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk, as these products have not been proven to be safe or effective.""","Matt - I'm glad you are bringing up this subject considering the massive amount of mis-information around the subject. I get calls from retailers, manufacturers and consumers from all across the country asking similar questions. You hit the nail on head and if you know anything about legislation and litigation you will know that every word is subject and suspect to scrutiny. The key word in your comment is ""Claim"". If you look at the published FDA articles you will see they've sent Cease and Desist letters to a number of companies making ""Health"" or ""Medical"" claims on their labels, packaging and websites. You will also notice that the majority of them are capitalists getting into this industry to make a quick buck. For those of us that have been in the industry for a number of years we've all known all along that making claims is the ""Hot Button"" and currently the only means of enforcement that the federal and state governments have at their disposal. For the record it is not illegal to manufacture, sell or consume CBD edibles or drinks containing CBD. It is however illegal to make medial or health benefit claims. We've been very careful to operate within the legal framework and I have zero concern that raising money, selling products and/or consuming CBD products will put myself or any of my companies at risk. Thank you."
Franny's Manufacturing,https://www.startengine.com/frannys-manufacturing,Matt Robeson,,No,8 days ago,"The USDA has made it clear that CBD edibles are illegal, as has North Carolina State gov't. The FDA said it will be at least 12 mos, probably more, until they get any meaningful regulatory outlook on edibles. For now, they are illegal, regardless of wether they're being sold, and a bank can freely revoke your privileges for them.","Matt - Thanks for the comment/question. I like to think that I'm a student of the industry where I read everything and anything related to hemp, CBD and Cannabis. The FDA has issued a couple ""Opinion"" pieces over the past year where they basically say edibles and drinks have not been tested for safety. It is they're obligation to protect the public and I respect their opinion. I've personally used cannabis for decades and I have thousands of customers using cannabis that I interact with on a daily basis. In my professional opinion there's nothing dangerous with using cannabis. If you were to dig into the influences behind the ""Opinion"" pieces you would quickly realize that the ammunition behind the FDA's opinion is originating from some very well funded and powerful lobby that competes with the growing cannabis industry. We in the cannabis space are well unified, funded and mobilized so my concerns are contained at a minimum. Until we have legitimately drafted, litigated and legislatively passed ""laws"" I'm planning to continue on my path of growth. That includes selling edibles and drinks. That's what pioneers do in an industry that was unjustly placed in prohibition for 76 years. Banks and credit card processing have been a challenge but we continue to figure out new and innovative ways to get our products into the hands of the customers that so desperately need them.

We also have a considerable value in our employees, inventory, intellectual property and equipment. The money raised in the previous campaigns was for our Distribution business that went to building our new website, new hires and inventory. It all went exactly as planned. This capital raise is intended to help purchase new equipment, increase marketing and hire key employees. The manufacturing business has been crucial in the growth of all the businesses.

A few areas of differentiation include:

1. Their product is much more expensive at $130/month for two sensors (a month's supply) and an additional cost of $85 for the sensor reader — compared to our initial price of $29/month which includes everything. Even with insurance coverage, based on their website, the Freestyle Libre costs ""$65 for a FreeStyle Libre 14 day reader,"" and as much as ""$75 per month for eligible FreeStyle Libre 14 day sensor prescriptions"";
2. GluCase is seamlessly connected to your smartphone; however, their reader/scanner system still requires the user to carry a separate bulky reader device;
3. We focus much more on real-time coaching by certified diabetes educators;
4. It must be noted that their technology is still invasive as the CGM sensor pierces the skin;
5. Lastly, their website even admits that fingersticks are still required in many instances: ""Fingersticks are required for treatment decisions when you see Check Blood Glucose symbol, when symptoms do not match system readings, when you suspect readings may be inaccurate, or when you experience symptoms that may be due to high or low blood glucose."" - https://www.freestylelibre.us/cgm-difference/benefits-of-cgm.html"

Thank you, those are great questions. Please find our answers inline below.

1. We have partnered with OtterBox, the #1 case manufacturer in North America. Our solution is modular and functions with their uniVERSE Case. We are compatible with the most popular iPhone and Samsung Galaxy models. Our bundle package includes the OtterBox uniVerse Case that fits their phone at no additional cost once they sign up for a monthly subscription.
2. We have minimized the need for multiple SKUs in view of potential design changes since the physical attachment piece on the GluCase that connects to the OtterBox uniVERSE Case maintains a constant form.
3. The white-labeled meter that we're using via our partnership with AgaMatrix is already FDA cleared and we're simply integrating it into our proprietary case system. You can find the official FDA summary here: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K152365.

- Are you developing other bikes? On a different startup website, there was an electric bike company that had different models for different levels of usage, such has off-road, track, etc..


Best regards,
Miguel Costa","Hi Miguel,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

- How does your sales traction looks like? Is there an increase in the number of sales throughout the years, or months?
A: Yes, we have a sale increase each month around 25% more in sales between 2018 and 2019.
Please note that we have a limitation of our sales due to low inventory. This is one of the reasons why we are seeking funding so we can increase our inventory also fulfill the demand.

- What percentage of your 200 bikes/year meets customer demand? Is the reason for this fund round to be able to answer the increase in demand?
A: At this point all of our bikes due meet the demand, the only level of usage we noticed is off-roading and we have already created the Scrambler for example for off-road use and the Rumble bike will be available next year with off-road kit.

- Are you developing other bikes? On a different startup website, there was an electric bike company that had different models for different levels of usage, such has off-road, track, etc..
A: We are actually developing a brand new model that will be released in February 2020.
The new model will be a great addition to the Rumble Motors portfolio and it will be a bike that the market has been asking for, we will release it first to our investors and also offer a great perk before the launch.

I hope this answered your questions, if not please let me know and I would gladly answer them."
OuroX,https://www.startengine.com/ourox,David Lanfair,52,No,8 days ago,"I've tried to invest in OuroX 3 times now (I think), and money has even come out of my account. And, then, each time the campaign has been extended. It's the only company that this has happened with. And I've been investing for about 3 years. It makes me apprehensive about why this company keeps doing this. It's also aggravating because of the opportunity costs (each time, I the money I allocated in OuroX could have been invested in something else whose campaign ended during that period that OuroX's was supposed to end). What gives?","Hi David, thanks for your message. We're in the process of receiving a license and helping put in place the necessary regulation to start operating as the National Securities Exchange of Suriname (Our home country in South America). This process has been taking much longer than expected, as it is government and moving through bureaucracy takes time.

What are your plans to increase adoption in Latin America? What challenges are you experiencing? I met several of your team at Blockchain Shift Miami and am really hoping that you are successful.,"Hi Aaron, hope you've been well!
It's great to hear from you. We went live in February, but have not yet started on-boarding customers. We delayed the start, because of the meetings about the LOI we signed in April. We recently announced that we will be operating and developing the National Securities Exchange in Suriname. In the next few months we will start on-boarding the broker dealers and their customers (The largest BD, which is the De Surinaamsche Bank, has 150.000 customers). We will also list the currently publicly traded companies on the exchange and use blockchain to digitize the securities. It delayed our start, but the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. It allows us to list securities and on-board institutional clients. We're working on a lot more cool stuff behind the scenes and we plan to launch OuroPay in partnership with a Bank in December.
Our dev team is currently working on adding Spanish and Portuguese languages on the exchange itself and we are upping our marketing efforts in both those languages as soon as they are done.
So we've been working hard on development and building a strong foundation for the business and believe that all of our combined efforts mentioned above will increase adoption in the region."

Thanks for your interest in Chow!

The design and development for both platforms (online market and automated dispensaries) have been completed. We've partnered with an electronics manufacturer to assembled our machines when needed and the online platform has been fully developed. Right now, our proposed launched date for both platforms is the week after the end of our campaign on StartEngine - Monday, January 20th 2020. For placement of our machines, we work with local businesses and pay about 10% of our monthly revenues. So far, we are working with multiple locations between Boston, New York, Philadelphia and DC to meet our goals for this round.

Our online marketplace works like Amazon/Ebay, we work with established brands that can ship directly to customers and we take 9% of all transactions.

Also can you give a quick break down on what the OTC is and how it works, please and thank you . (Excited about this company!)","The OTC (Over The Counter) market refers to the process of how securities are traded for companies that are not listed on a formal exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Securities that are traded over-the-counter are traded through a broker-dealer network as opposed to on a centralized exchange. You can learn more at https://www.otcmarkets.com/.

While nothing is guaranteed by any means, we are looking at an opportunity that would benefit us as a company as well as our investors. If we were to become a publicly traded company on the OTC it would give our investors liquidity options through sales of their shares on the OTC."

Also, two questions: 1. Could you update your finances - I totally understand the challenges you faced this year and I'm glad you've solved them (but I get that YTD numbers may be misleading). What is your current cash on hand, monthly revenue/expense, and monthly debt payments? 2. I read what happens if you raise the minimum and maximum, but what is the minimum you need to raise to buy at least a 12-18 month runway without having to raise more? Thanks!","Hi Alan…Thanks for investing! We appreciate the support. I will check in with Startengine in regard to how and when the 20% bonus shares will be reflected.

1. Our current cash on hand is 38K. Prior to the processing outage, we were ramping up for a big marketing push. Our objective was to push our monthly sales over the 100k mark. We had cash stores of 150K and inventory totaling over 500K. The processing outage occurred with an email on April 31st letting out know that our processing for Visa would stop May 1st. We maintained normal operations in the month of May. After May we greatly reduced our operating expenses. Capital expenses were devoted to closing purchase orders on products ordered months before and investment in a new website to support our marketing efforts.

2. Our current monthly hard cost is under 10K, we have maintained our lean expenses post outage. These include warehousing, loan payments, and all tools. Monthly revenue ranges from 25k to 45k. These revenues are directly related to our marketing efforts. We project we will do more than 50k in February. Our marketing budget currently ranges from 3K - 10K depending on how many channels we have open. These low-cost social media marketing efforts produce good retune when properly managed.

3. We are currently self-sufficient but expanding at a slower pace than we would like which is why we are here. The minimum we would need to raise to the last 12- 18 months is 15K. We don’t need capital to continue operating successfully but we need the capital to push our revenue over the 125K a month mark. The minimum amount we would need to successfully achieve this monthly revenue goal is 100K. Our strategy involves expanding our direct to consumer sales through accusation of influencers with markets over 1 million and placing our products in international distribution; Kuwait, Bermuda, Australia, India and more expected in the near future. We are starting or influencer acquisition this month and will be introducing our campaign members to a new influencer with a market of 3 million this month. Our goal is to impact as many people in a positive light that we can. We did not create this company to serve ourselves that being the case we are looking for more explosive growth. We created Hara to deliver a new standard when it comes to CPG’s surviving the people and planet.

4. We appreciate you!"

It varies from different manufacturers and models, the good news is we get it! EBT scanners are older technology but still very fast and FDA approved and very accurate for Heart and lung scanning.

NIRA Skin,https://www.startengine.com/nira-skin,eric mabo,5,No,a month ago,Do you have any revenue numbers?,"We closed 2019 with $476,000 in revenues. The vast majority of this was after our mass-market launch in late-September. Revenue growth continues to be strong, in my opinion, especially for a new brand at high price point which is developing a new approach to anti-aging. We find the product sells well when it is demonstrated and the audience is educated on the approach and benefits. With this, we are seeing excellent traction in home shopping channels where we are now regularly selling the product on Ideal World in the UK and we now have orders to begin selling in the TV home shopping market in the USA in February. The USA TV home shopping is estimated to be 10X the UK channel we are using, so we expect accelerated growth if this goes well in the US. We are also finalizing other home shopping deals in Germany and other parts of Europe. Hong Kong sales have commenced and we plan on moving volumes sales through Asia within this year. Other venues for demonstrating the product include unpaid PR opportunities on US TV where we are actively supporting projects that may air within the year.

However, we have many clients that have seen improvements with acne, puffiness, wrinkles around the mouth/forehead and other blemishes on the face when consistently using the NIRA Skincare Laser.

It's great that the product is already FDA cleared. How many competitors are out there who have similar kind of product ?? Also, what are the revenues for the last two years ? The valuation seems little high !! How much of your personal money you have invested in the company ??","Sorry for the delay in my response; been away at CES show last week which went very well. Plus, I am just bouncing back from a common cold. We have $476,000 in revenues in 2019 which were nearly all from the last 3 months of the year. Our mass-market launch was late September 2019. Revenues are building nicely with repeat orders from distributors as well as growth in response to our direct marketing efforts. Most direct competitors that offer laser for wrinkle reduction (Palomar, Philips ReAura, Iluminage,etc) withdrew their offerings which I believe is due to the product side effects of pain, redness plus high pricing at $500 or more. Tria Beauty is still on the market but went through financial restructuring and their product has the same issues at stated above. The NIRA is the only anti-aging laser device that avoids the pain and redness and gets great results. Our pricing is also favorable, although Tria often discounts to lower levels. Indirect competition such as topical creams are everywhere, but really do not address the underlying wrinkly issue of build collagen and volume in the dermal layers to offer long-lasting results."

Both similar solutions and other options? metal detectors, armed guards, teachers, etc. How do costs compare?","Hi Dean, these are really great questions and may be a bit large for this venue but I’ll give it a try: you are right, likelihood of a school or any other building being attacked is small but there is a massive demand for bulletproofing systems. The federal government is dedicating large tranches of money to protect schools and the federal money is just a small part of each schools budget. The fact is the safety portion of each schools budget is bigger than most realize. There are a few competitors: some companies offer thick Fiberglas paneling that are attached to the exterior of the wall. The problem is that all other systems for bulletproofing are not retrofittable and therefore much more expensive than the Rhino Hide system. Other products take months to install and cost many times more. Rhino Hide can be installed in days or even over a weekend without interrupting class schedules. Metal detectors are good but only half measures. They don’t stop an intruder they just let you know that an intruder is there. Armed guards are excellent but they require paying a salary forever.

I appreciate the professionalism--it is noticed. I missed out on reinvesting at the lower valuation but I won't wait again.

You're doing great work, tell your research team to keep at it...All the best to Team Rhino Hide.",Thanks Becky. Stay tuned. We should have an exciting update coming up on Monday!
"Rhino Hide, Incorporated",https://www.startengine.com/rhino-hide-inc,Roy Pirhala,69,No,2 months ago,"Your updates have been timely and informative. Will you keep us investors in mind with continued communications well after the closings? Too many companies here on Start Engine disappear without a word after all the money is raised, something too many people here are now aware.",Definitely! It’s hard to keep up with the updates... I see how folks can let them slip Plus we need to be carful what we say to be sure it complies with the SEC rules. I have even taken too long on my updates sometimes but you are all the reason we have any hope to succeed so I will always do my best to keep you updated.
"Rhino Hide, Incorporated",https://www.startengine.com/rhino-hide-inc,Ryan McGrail,5,No,2 months ago,"Round #1 was $1 a share
Round #2 is $2.50 a share
You haven’t even sent out the Bonus Perks for Round #1 yet and your raising more money at a higher valuation.

What has changed that gives this company now a $2.50/share value?","Hi Ryan, in my defense, I haven’t sent out the second half of the perks because StartEngine took a long time to get me their final CAP table which shows who gets what... and in their defense, it takes a while to get all that straight. I have it now and the stuff has been ordered. But that also takes a while. Coins will be here Friday and should go out next week. Shirts will be ready soon after that but they take longer because not everyone answers my email request for size etc. The reason the valuation is higher is because we have made significant progress especially regarding agreements with several customers to purchase many millions of dollars worth of product every year. The update below is just one and it’s $18M per year in sales. We are working on many many more. This company is a great deal even at $2.50, in my opinion."

SōKO,https://www.startengine.com/soko,Delbert Reynolds,40,Yes,8 days ago,I would like to invest if you could respond to Lucianos questions,"Hi Delbert

I have responded to Lucianos questions below. Please feel free to reach out with any further questions or concerns! Have a great rest of your night."
SōKO,https://www.startengine.com/soko,luciano ferreira,17,No,9 days ago,"Hi, so it’s kind confusing first said that first year was no profit and then next year 255 profit and u guys report 2019 $400 profit and then below $190 profit ... I don’t get it also why 10 million valuation?","Hi Luciano, Thank you for reaching out with your questions. In 2018 we reported a loss with no profit because most of our revenue went towards cost of goods. Thus creating a profit of 225k in 2019 as we no longer had as many cost of goods as the inventory followed through from 2018 to 2019. Our Revenue was over 400k on 2019 and over 190k in profit. I apologize as it looks like the graphic wasn't updated with the most current financials as we've been preparing for this raise since before December. The financials in the offing document are the most representative of the up to this date finances.
I will try to help as much as possible though so let me know if this answers any questions! As for our valuation, I have copied our valuation statement from our offering memorandum for your records. We at Soko have different trademarks and IP that are also included in detail in the filings. Thank you Luciano and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day!

Valuation Statement"" We at Soko Group, Inc. came to this valuation by assessing our partnerships, percentage of revenue increase and attribution to the Global hemp CBD and fashion industries respectively. Our valuation is based on internal factors such as our market reach, our customer base, and our revenue.
Currently, we have two key partnerships leading to our success, first our formulation partner for our hemp beverages, Symrise, and secondly, our primary product manufacturer, 12 Crowns Inc.
Our market reach includes Soko Group serving over 50 locations with reorders. Soko Group has returning e-commerce clients with over $470,000 worth of product revenue moved in Q3 2018 - Q3 2019. Our $225,000 profit for 2019 is a $412% increase from 2018 and we are hoping to continue that trend for the next 3 years. We utilized the above information to analyze our 3 year estimated revenue at just over $14 Million.
In addition to our current market, we believe we have positioned ourselves for a massive expansion into Europe as well as South America for Hemp CBD Products. Currently, we have product sales underway and contracts being established with manufacturers overseas.
Looking at the industry overall, CBD is growing to be a $22 billion market in the US by 2022 and a $318 million market in the UK in 2018 and expected to grow by 400% percent by 2023. We believe Soko Group is positioned to capitalize on the markets before they become saturated.
In addition to the hemp CBD market, we also looked to the hemp fashion industry as a secondary market comparison. The fashion industry is valued at $1.5 Trillion. Soko Group Inc. already has a market share in the hemp fashion and everyday apparel sections. Soko Group's CEO, Dave Sokolowski, has previously created a successful fashion event company known nationwide for innovative and decadent runway shows which led to Dave bringing this experience to Soko Group's fashion shows today. We have grown a following through these events proving the value and the steady demand for hemp clothing. By building on and expanding the different apparel we offer, we can anticipate a new vertical to be added that will further add value to the current valuation.
In conclusion, we believe the above information gives Soko Group, Inc. a major advantage over competitors through brand recognition, product distribution territories, market share, and customer loyalty overall when it comes to becoming a household name globally.
Our valuation was determined internally and not using a formal third-party independent valuation."
"SitTight, Inc.",https://www.startengine.com/sittight-inc,Jordan Talley,7,No,2 months ago,"Hello,

This seems like a great product/company and I am interested in investing! Have you seen continued revenue growth, improving margins and decreasing net losses in 2019?

Happy Holidays,

Jordan Talley","Hello Jordan,

Thank you for your interest in SitTight and your kind words about our product/company.

As you may have noticed on our campaign page, we spent much of 2019 refocussing our efforts on medical and education opportunities. We paused our advertising and selling efforts in the office furniture market. This caused our gross sales to slow down, but margins remained about the same. As a result of this, and some depreciation that was taken, our losses increased as part of our long-term plan.

We are very excited about 2020 as we begin to sell in the medical technology sector with our first new distribution partner the space. We will be exhibiting with them at the Consumer Electronics Show here in Las Vegas in early January.

Please let us know if there are any other question we can answer for you.

All the best,

Scott Bahneman
